# Implementation Plan: Onboarding Production Hardening — Progressive Experience Production-Hardening Checkpoint

## Overview

Seven absolute release blockers, in delivery order. Each task maps directly to a design section in `design.md` and specific acceptance criteria in `requirements.md`. Deferred items (WizardDraftStore, OfflineBanner, PendingMutationStore, Axios retry, conflict resolution, analytics, i18n, accessibility, payment recovery) were excluded from the earlier production-hardening checkpoint. After Recovery Checkpoint R0 and completed production-hardening implementation groups, WizardDraftStore is now authorized only as the separate Progressive Experience implementation group defined below.

Language: **TypeScript / React Native (Expo)**

---

## Phase Terminology

Use `Progressive Experience Phase 0`, `Progressive Experience Phase 1`, `Progressive Experience Phase 2`, and so on for future work.

Historical mapping:

```text
Legacy "Sprint 1" = Progressive Experience production-hardening checkpoint
Legacy "release gate" = Progressive Experience production-hardening checkpoint
```

## Tasks

### Recovery Checkpoint R0: COMPLETE

- [x] R0.1 Move/copy accepted specs to tracked canonical location
  - Canonical path: `frontend/docs/Onboarding/progressive-experience/`
  - `.kiro` must not remain the sole source of truth.
  - Do not mark complete until the docs are committed or otherwise traceable in Git.

- [x] R0.2 Update references
  - Requirements, design, tasks, reconciliation, and recovery checkpoint must point to the canonical tracked docs path.
  - Kiro copies must be treated as workspace mirrors.

- [x] R0.3 Verify clean paired branch baselines
  - Frontend and backend must start from latest `origin/dev`.
  - Use `feature/progressive-experience-recovery` in both repositories.
  - Do not reuse stale `origin/feature/progressive-experience-phase-1`.

- [x] R0.4 Verify backend idempotency status
  - Current status: `VERIFIED_IN_DEV`.
  - Backend recovery commits `c5082fb`, `f145dbf`, `a2a818b`, `bc6d446`, and `a82103d` implement Platform Foundation idempotency, onboarding step submission integration, migration `20260712_000001`, approved tenant-scoped persistence naming, fresh database migration-chain repair, and focused tests.
  - Fresh local `novaclinics_test` rebuild reaches `20260712_000001 (head)`.
  - Staging same-key replay/tenant-isolation checks remain release blockers, not implementation-readiness blockers.

- [x] R0.5 Define tenant-resolution staging checks
  - Cover `/auth/me`, onboarding/provisional tenants, live tenants, tenant switching, `X-Tenant-ID` compatibility, and cross-tenant submission safety.
  - Staging execution is blocked until staging URL, credentials, and safe tenants are provided.

- [x] R0.6 Complete or formally defer Hindi localization
  - Hindi Progressive Experience localization is complete in `hi-IN.json`.
  - Key parity check confirms 77 Hindi keys and 77 English keys with no missing or extra keys.
  - Interpolation variables are preserved.

- [x] R0.7 Issue GO/NO-GO report
  - Recovery / implementation readiness: `GO`.
  - Production promotion readiness: `NO-GO`.
  - Baseline frontend Jest/TypeScript failures and staging-only tenant/replay checks remain tracked release blockers.
  - Next authorized work: execute the first incomplete task group in this file.

- [x] 1. Create shared `SERVICE_CATALOGUE_ALIASES` constant
  - Create `frontend/features/onboarding/constants/stepAliases.ts`
  - Export `SERVICE_CATALOGUE_ALIASES` as a `const` array containing all **five** service-catalogue step codes: `treatments_and_therapies`, `services_and_specialities`, `services`, `services_offered`, `treatment_services`
  - Export the `ServiceCatalogueAlias` derived type
  - Add a source comment documenting the backend template audit origin (per Req 4 AC-3) — note that additional aliases may be added here after the backend template audit is complete
  - _Requirements: 1 AC-3, 2 AC-2, 4 AC-3_

- [x] 2. Fix alias routing in `StepDetailScreen`
  - [x] 2.1 Extend `redirectSteps` map in `StepDetailScreen.tsx`
    - Import `SERVICE_CATALOGUE_ALIASES` from `stepAliases.ts`
    - Replace any existing `treatments_and_therapies` / `services_and_specialities` entries with a spread of all aliases pointing to `/clinic-admin/settings/treatments`
    - Retain all existing non-service-catalogue entries (`rooms_and_therapy_beds`, `treatment_rooms`, `staff_and_roles`, `staff_setup`, `staff_members`, `inventory_setup`) unchanged
    - _Requirements: 1 AC-1, 1 AC-2, 1 AC-3_

  - [x]* 2.2 Write unit tests for `StepDetailScreen` alias routing
    - Test that `services`, `services_offered`, and `treatment_services` each redirect to `/clinic-admin/settings/treatments`
    - Test that an unrecognised step code continues existing behaviour (no redirect match)
    - _Requirements: 1 AC-1, 1 AC-2_
    - **Property 5: Alias Routing Is Exhaustive and Consistent**
    - **Validates: Requirements 1 AC-3, 2 AC-2**

- [x] 3. Fix alias routing in `SetupWizardFlow`
  - [x] 3.1 Update `renderStepContent` switch in `SetupWizardFlow.tsx`
    - Import `SERVICE_CATALOGUE_ALIASES` and `ServiceCatalogueAlias` from `stepAliases.ts`
    - Replace the existing hardcoded case list (`treatments_and_therapies`, `services_and_specialities`) with a single `if (SERVICE_CATALOGUE_ALIASES.includes(currentStep.code as ServiceCatalogueAlias))` branch at the top of `renderStepContent`
    - The branch must render the **existing** inline redirect card JSX unchanged — do NOT extract a new `RedirectCard` component (that introduces unnecessary scope for a release sprint)
    - The redirect card heading must display the string `"Treatments & Therapies"` regardless of which alias triggered the render
    - The redirect button must navigate to `/clinic-admin/settings/treatments`
    - All colours and spacing must come from `useClinicTheme()` — zero hardcoded values
    - _Requirements: 2 AC-1, 2 AC-2, 2 AC-3_

  - [x]* 3.2 Write unit tests for `SetupWizardFlow` alias routing
    - Test that `services`, `services_and_specialities`, and `treatment_services` each render the Treatments redirect card
    - Test that the card heading label is "Treatments & Therapies" for all aliases
    - _Requirements: 2 AC-1, 2 AC-3_
    - **Property 5: Alias Routing Is Exhaustive and Consistent**
    - **Validates: Requirements 2 AC-2**

- [x] 4. Delete `TreatmentsAndTherapiesScreen.tsx`
  - Delete `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/TreatmentsAndTherapiesScreen.tsx`
  - Run the TypeScript build (`npx tsc --noEmit`) — must pass with zero type errors (confirms no live import depended on this file)
  - Run ESLint on the onboarding feature directory — must pass with no import/no-unresolved errors
  - Run the full onboarding test suite (`npm test -- --config=tests/onboarding/jest.config.js`) — all pre-existing tests must still pass
  - _Requirements: 3 AC-1, 3 AC-2_

- [x] 5. Checkpoint — alias routing complete
  - Focused alias-routing verification passed:
    `npm test -- --runInBand tests/onboarding/StepDetailScreen.test.tsx tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx`
    reported 2 passed suites and 17 passed tests.
  - `TreatmentsAndTherapiesScreen.tsx` remains absent.
  - Release-level frontend Jest/TypeScript baseline debt remains tracked in the recovery checkpoint and does not block implementation sequencing.

- [x] 6. Implement duplicate submission lock and `submissionId` guard in `SetupWizardFlow`
  - [x] 6.1 Add `isPending` CTA lock and loading spinner
    - Disable the "Next" CTA button and set `accessibilityState={{ disabled: true }}` when `submitMutation.isPending === true`
    - Disable the "Complete" and "Go Live" CTA buttons when `useCompleteSetupMutation.isPending === true`
    - Render a loading spinner / `ActivityIndicator` in place of the button label while any relevant mutation is pending
    - Use `useClinicTheme()` for all spinner/button style values
    - _Requirements: 26 AC-1, 26 AC-2, 26 AC-4_

  - [x] 6.2 Add `submissionId` ref and stale-callback guard
    - Generate a UUID v4 `submissionId` each time the user taps "Next" (only when `isPending` is `false`)
    - Store it in a `useRef` local to `SetupWizardFlow`
    - In `onSuccess` and `onError` callbacks, compare the callback's captured `submissionId` against the current ref value; if they differ, silently return without updating UI state or navigating
    - Reset (new UUID) on each new explicit submission attempt
    - _Requirements: 26 AC-6, 26 AC-7_

  - [x] 6.3 Add `Idempotency-Key` header to step submission API call
    - In `frontend/features/onboarding/data/datasources/onboarding.api.ts`, update `submitStepDataApi` to accept an optional `idempotencyKey?: string` parameter
    - When provided, send it as the `Idempotency-Key` request header: `headers: { 'Idempotency-Key': idempotencyKey }`
    - In `SetupWizardFlow.tsx`, pass `submissionIdRef.current` as the `idempotencyKey` argument on every `submitStepDataApi` call — the same UUID generated in task 6.2 is reused here, so a network retry of the same tap carries the same key
    - When the user initiates a **new** submission attempt (new tap, new `submissionId` generated), a fresh UUID is naturally used — no extra logic needed
    - _Requirements: 12 AC-1, 12 AC-2, 12 AC-5_

  - [x]* 6.4 Write unit tests for duplicate submission prevention
    - Test that rapid successive "Next" taps while `isPending === true` call `submitStepDataApi` exactly once
    - Test that a stale `submissionId` callback is a no-op (no navigation, no state update)
    - Test that the `Idempotency-Key` header value sent in the request matches `submissionIdRef.current`
    - _Requirements: 26 AC-5, 26 AC-6, 12 AC-1_
    - _Requirements: 26 AC-5, 26 AC-6_
    - **Property 1: No Double Submission**
    - **Validates: Requirements 26 AC-1, 26 AC-5**
    - **Property 3: Stale Callbacks Are Silent No-ops**
    - **Validates: Requirements 26 AC-6**

- [x] 7. Implement submit → `await refetch()` → advance ordering in `SetupWizardFlow`
  - [x] 7.1 Enforce sequential submit → refetch → advance in `handleNext`
    - In `handleNext`, after `useSubmitStepMutation` resolves successfully, call `refetch()` on the onboarding status query and `await` its completion before calling `setCurrentStepIndex` or `router.replace(dashboard)`
    - The wizard must NOT advance step index before the refetch resolves
    - Errors in refetch should be caught and surfaced via `Alert.alert` consistent with existing error handling
    - _Requirements: 26 AC-8_

  - [x]* 7.2 Write integration test for submit → refetch → advance ordering
    - Mock `submitStepDataApi` with a delayed resolution and verify `currentStepIndex` does NOT increment until the mocked `refetch()` resolves
    - Confirm the ordering: submit resolves → refetch response received → step index increments
    - _Requirements: 26 AC-8_
    - **Property 2: Step Advances Only After Refetch**
    - **Validates: Requirements 26 AC-8**

- [x] 8. Add query invalidation after step submit
  - [x] 8.1 Call `invalidateQueries` in `useSubmitStepMutation.onSuccess`
    - In `onboarding.repository.impl.ts`, inside `useSubmitStepMutation`'s `onSuccess` callback, add `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: onboardingKeys.status(tenantId) })`
    - **Tenant source:** Repository hooks cannot import Zustand stores directly (see architecture dependency rules in `design.md`). Therefore, `tenantId` must be passed as an argument from the call site (e.g., extend `useSubmitStepMutation` to accept `tenantId` as a parameter), rather than reading from `useAuthStore()` inside the repository hook.
    - Do not hard-code or inline a query key string
    - _Requirements: 27 AC-1_

  - [x]* 8.2 Write integration test for query invalidation
    - After a step submission succeeds, verify that a subsequent render of `SetupWizardFlow` using the refetched query shows the updated `per_step_validation[stepCode].status`
    - _Requirements: 27 AC-1, 27 AC-6_

- [x] 9. Checkpoint — submission ordering and invalidation complete
  - Focused submission and invalidation verification passed:
    `npm test -- --runInBand tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx tests/onboarding/onboarding.repository.test.tsx tests/onboarding/onboarding.api.test.ts`
    reported 3 passed suites and 16 passed tests.
  - Verified coverage includes duplicate submission lock, `Idempotency-Key` forwarding, stale callback guards, submit -> refetch -> advance ordering, and `onboardingKeys.status(tenantId)` invalidation.
  - Jest open-handle behavior remains baseline test-environment debt after the pass summary.

- [x] 10. Implement Android hardware back button intercept in `SetupWizardFlow`
  - [x] 10.1 Register `BackHandler` listener on mount
    - In `SetupWizardFlow.tsx`, add a `useEffect` that calls `BackHandler.addEventListener('hardwareBackPress', handler)` on mount and removes it via the returned cleanup on unmount
    - The handler must return `true` (consuming the event) on every press while the component is mounted, preventing the default OS back behaviour
    - _Requirements: 10 AC-3_

  - [x] 10.2 Navigate to previous step on back press (non-first step)
    - In the `BackHandler` handler, when `currentStepIndex > 0`, call the existing `handlePrevious` function to navigate to the previous wizard step
    - Do NOT call `router.back()` or any other navigation method — use only `handlePrevious`
    - _Requirements: 10 AC-1_

  - [x] 10.3 Consume event without navigation when on first step
    - In the `BackHandler` handler, when `currentStepIndex === 0`, return `true` without calling any navigation function; the wizard must NOT exit
    - _Requirements: 10 AC-2_

  - [x]* 10.4 Write unit tests for Android back button handling
    - Test that pressing back when on step > 0 calls `handlePrevious` and does not call `router.back()` or `router.replace()`
    - Test that pressing back when on step 0 does not navigate and does not exit the wizard
    - _Requirements: 10 AC-1, 10 AC-2, 10 AC-3_
    - **Property 4: Android Back Never Exits Wizard**
    - **Validates: Requirements 10 AC-3**

- [ ] 11. Tenant resolution and backend idempotency — verification tasks
  - Status: Implementation complete. Automated verification complete. Awaiting staging verification.

  | Acceptance Item | Planned | Already Implemented | Verified | Remaining |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Authenticated tenant resolution | Verify `/auth/me` and tenant context for onboarding and live tenants. | `/auth/me` exposes `tenant_id`; frontend maps it to `tenantId`; backend path-tenant authorization resolves membership through `get_tenant_user_context` / `require_permission`. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE. Staging NOT_EXECUTED. | Staging verification for provisional and active tenants. |
  | Authoritative route tenant | Onboarding commands use explicit tenant route context. | Backend `submit_step_data` uses path `tenant_id` as idempotency scope tenant and service command tenant. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | Staging route/JWT/header behavior. |
  | Tenant isolation | Same idempotency key must not replay across tenants. | Platform scope includes tenant, actor, operation, and key; table unique constraint is `uq_tenant_idempotency_scope_key`. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | Staging replay check across tenants. |
  | Same key in different tenants | Same key may execute independently in different tenant scopes. | `PlatformIdempotencyService` and onboarding integration scope keys by tenant. | VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | Staging same-key cross-tenant confirmation. |
  | Operation isolation | Same key may execute independently for different operations. | Platform scope includes operation. | VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | None for implementation; staging confirmation before promotion. |
  | Onboarding step isolation | Same key may execute independently for different onboarding steps. | Operation identity is `onboarding.step_submit:{step_code}`. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | None for implementation; staging confirmation before promotion. |
  | Replay protection | Same key and same payload replay returns cached completed response without duplicate domain execution. | Platform service stores completed response body and onboarding route rehydrates `StepSubmissionResponse`. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | Staging same-key replay. |
  | Same key with different payload | Reusing a key with a different payload must conflict. | Request fingerprint includes route tenant, step code, and request body. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | None for implementation; staging confirmation before promotion. |
  | Concurrent duplicate request | Concurrent duplicate must not execute duplicate side effects. | Platform claim is atomic via unique scoped record; in-progress duplicate returns conflict. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | Staging/load-style retry check if feasible. |
  | Retry after timeout / retryable failure | Same key and same payload can retry after retryable failure. | Service marks transient failures as `FAILED_RETRYABLE` and can reclaim the same scoped key/fingerprint. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | Staging retry-after-timeout scenario. |
  | Missing-key compatibility | Existing clients without key preserve legacy behavior. | Onboarding route bypasses platform idempotency when `Idempotency-Key` is absent. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | None. |
  | `X-Tenant-ID` behavior | Verify JWT tenant or fallback header behavior. | Frontend retains `X-Tenant-ID` with `// TODO: Req 11`; backend onboarding route uses path tenant and does not trust the header for idempotency scope. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and frontend API test; staging NOT_EXECUTED. | Staging mismatch/fallback verification before removing fallback. |
  | Cross-tenant rejection | Non-org-admin submitting another tenant's route must be rejected. | Onboarding service rejects non-org-admin when user tenant differs from route tenant; idempotency record remains scoped to route tenant. | VERIFIED_IN_CODE and VERIFIED_IN_TEST. | Staging cross-tenant rejection and replay attempt. |

  - [x] 11.0 Reconcile existing backend implementation and automated tests
    - Backend implementation evidence:
      `docs/adr/ADR-PF-001-reusable-request-idempotency.md`,
      `app/application/platform/idempotency_service.py`,
      `app/infrastructure/repositories/platform_idempotency_repository.py`,
      `app/infrastructure/db/models/platform_idempotency_record.py`,
      migration `20260712_000001_platform_idempotency_records.py`,
      `tenant_idempotency_records`, and
      `app/api/v1/routers/onboarding_router.py`.
    - Focused backend verification passed:
      `DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg:///novaclinics_test REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0 JWT_SECRET_KEY=test-secret .venv-idempotency/bin/pytest -q tests/test_platform_idempotency_service.py tests/test_onboarding_idempotency_integration.py`
      reported 12 passed tests.
    - Frontend API verification passed:
      `npm test -- --runInBand tests/onboarding/onboarding.api.test.ts`
      reported 1 passed suite and 2 passed tests for `Idempotency-Key` and `X-Tenant-ID` header behavior.

  - [ ] 11.1 Verify tenant resolution on staging
    - Inspect the JWT returned by `/auth/me` for both a PROVISIONAL tenant and a live tenant on the staging environment
    - Confirm `tenant_id` is present and non-null in both cases, OR confirm the `X-Tenant-ID` header fallback in `onboarding.api.ts` is working correctly on staging
    - If the backend fix (Req 11) has NOT been deployed: ensure `onboarding.api.ts` retains the `'X-Tenant-ID': tenantId` header and `console.warn` fallback with a `// TODO: Req 11` comment
    - If the backend fix HAS been deployed: remove the `X-Tenant-ID` workaround header from `onboarding.api.ts` and the `console.warn` fallback from `ChoiceScreen.tsx` (Req 11 AC-2, AC-3)
    - Record verification outcome in this task group before integration into `test`
    - _Requirements: 11 AC-1, 11 AC-2, 11 AC-3, 11 AC-4_

  - [ ] 11.2 Verify backend idempotency on staging
    - Send two identical `POST /api/v1/onboarding/{tenantId}/steps/{stepCode}` requests with the same `Idempotency-Key` UUID to the staging environment
    - Confirm: (a) the second response returns the cached result without creating a duplicate record; (b) the onboarding status query after both requests shows the step completed exactly once
    - Include same-key replay, retry after timeout, `X-Tenant-ID` mismatch, revoked membership, and cross-tenant replay attempt cases
    - If the backend does not yet honour the header in staging, record this as a P0 open item and block integration/promotion until confirmed
    - _Requirements: 12 AC-6_

- [ ] 12. Final checkpoint — all Progressive Experience production-hardening checkpoint blockers complete
  - Ensure all tests pass, ask the user if questions arise.
  - Confirm the release checklist in `design.md` is fully signed off: all 7 blockers verified, tenant resolution confirmed, idempotency confirmed.

### Progressive Experience Phase 1

- [x] 13. Wizard Draft Persistence Hardening
  - Decision: `REQUIREMENT_5_IS_NEXT`
  - Status: Implementation complete. Focused verification complete. Ready for architectural review.
  - Objective: preserve incomplete onboarding form input across navigation and app restarts without allowing local draft state to become onboarding completion truth or leak across tenants/users.
  - Requirement trace: Requirement 5 AC-1 through AC-12; supporting architecture rules in Requirements 22, 23, 30, and 31; deferred design sections `Deferred Components (Post-Release)`, `Deferred Data Models (Post-Release)`, `Dependency Rules (Req 22, 23)`, `Deferred Data Flows (Post-Release)`, and `Deferred Tests (Post-Release)`.
  - Ownership boundary:
    - Frontend owns local unsaved draft state, persistence of incomplete form input, hydration, validation, migration, corrupt-data recovery, and safe discard/reset.
    - Frontend does not own backend completion truth, onboarding readiness, lifecycle state, activation eligibility, subscription truth, or server-side synchronization.
    - Draft persistence must never make a step appear complete unless backend onboarding status confirms completion.
  - Existing implementation findings:
    - Reuse and evolve `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/stores/wizard.store.ts`; do not create a parallel draft store.
    - Current store persists `wizardData` under global key `wizard-storage` with `version: 0`; it is not tenant-scoped, has no exported `syncWizardDraftToStorage` / `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage`, no unified `DraftEntry`, no migration function, no compression path, and no explicit corrupt-data recovery contract.
    - Current step screens use `useWizardStore` for temporary UI draft data; `ClinicProfileScreen` also calls `useWizardStore.getState()` directly and should be aligned with Requirement 22/23 where touched.
    - Existing test coverage: `frontend/tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts` covers in-memory tenant switching only; persisted tenant/user isolation, schema migration, corrupt storage, compression, and reset storage removal are missing.
    - Backend impact: `UNKNOWN`; Requirement 5 is local draft persistence only and does not require backend schema or API changes.

  | Requirement 5 Item | Design Support | Existing Code | Gap | Dependency |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Unified `DraftEntry` with `data`, `createdAt`, `lastSavedAt` | Deferred data models mention `DraftEntry`; Requirements 5 and 31 define fields. | `wizardData` stores raw per-step data only. | Add unified draft entry model. | None. |
  | Zustand state slice with synchronous actions only | Dependency rules and Requirement 22. | `useWizardStore` has synchronous actions, but custom persistence wrapper performs async side effects. | Separate synchronous slice from exported async storage functions. | Preserve existing callers or migrate them intentionally. |
  | `immer` and `subscribeWithSelector` middleware | Requirement 22; design says match auth-store conventions. | Store uses plain Zustand; package has Zustand, but `immer` is not a declared direct dependency. | Add/confirm dependency and middleware application. | Package dependency decision for `immer`. |
  | Tenant/user-scoped AsyncStorage key | Requirement 5 AC-4 and Requirement 30. | Global key `wizard-storage`; in-memory tenant reset only. | Implement `@novaclinics/{tenantId}/wizard_draft_v1` and fallback `@novaclinics/user_{userId}/wizard_draft_v1`. | Auth store tenant/user access. |
  | Safe hydration | Requirement 5 AC-5 and AC-6. | Custom middleware hydrates automatically and logs warning on error. | Add explicit `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage()` with parse validation, migration, corrupt-entry removal, and no throw. | None. |
  | Storage sync | Requirement 5 AC-4, AC-7, AC-8. | Custom middleware persists on every set with no size/compression contract. | Add explicit `syncWizardDraftToStorage()` with size guard, compression, and recoverable errors. | `lz-string` dependency; telemetry path. |
  | Migration `v0 -> v1` | Requirement 5 AC-12. | Persisted payload writes `{ state, version: 0 }`. | Add `migrateDraft()` and `DraftMigrationError`; migrate split/raw legacy payloads where possible. | Existing global key compatibility decision. |
  | Selectors | Requirement 5 AC-9 and AC-10. | `getStepData` action exists; no pure selectors. | Export pure `selectStepDraft(stepCode)` and `selectStepDraftLastSavedAt(stepCode)`. | None. |
  | Reset removes persisted entry | Requirement 5 AC-11 and Requirement 30. | `resetWizard()` resets memory only. | Remove tenant/user-scoped persisted entry during reset/exported cleanup path. | Auth store identity available at reset time. |
  | Draft expiry | Requirement 31. | None. | Add per-step expiry during hydration only if included in this group. | Remote config override is `OPEN_DECISION`; no verified remote config path in current audit. |
  | Telemetry for storage failure/expiry | Requirement 5 AC-7/AC-8 and Requirement 31 AC-3. | No verified onboarding telemetry utility; analytics feature is reporting UI/API, not an event emitter. | `OPEN_DECISION`: either add a minimal approved event utility or record console-only fallback before implementation. | Requirement 28 architecture decision. |

  - [x] 13.1 Inventory and compatibility plan
    - Document the current persisted payload shape for `wizard-storage` (`{ state: { tenantId, wizardData }, version: 0 }`) and any observed test fixtures.
    - Decide whether implementation must migrate the global legacy key, ignore it, or safely discard it after tenant-scoped storage is introduced.
    - Confirm whether `financials_and_tax` and `payment_setup` draft data are safe for AsyncStorage under Requirement 19; exclude sensitive fields if needed.
    - Resolve `OPEN_DECISION` items for telemetry and draft expiry remote-config override before code changes.
    - Outcome: legacy `wizard-storage` v0 payloads are migrated only when identity validation is safe; scoped v1 keys are tenant/user/version based. No card/token data is stored by `financials_and_tax` or `payment_setup`; stored values remain local form settings. Telemetry uses the existing console event pattern because no dedicated onboarding event emitter exists. Draft expiry uses the documented default constant; no verified remote-config provider exists in the current codebase.
    - _Requirements: 5 AC-4, 5 AC-5, 5 AC-7, 5 AC-8, 5 AC-12, 19 AC-3, 31 AC-4_

  - [x] 13.2 Refactor existing wizard store schema
    - Evolve `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/stores/wizard.store.ts` into the Requirement 5 draft schema without creating a second store.
    - Add `version`, `stepDrafts`, `setStepDraft`, `clearStepDraft`, and `reset` using unified `DraftEntry`.
    - Preserve existing callers through intentional adapter methods only where needed during migration; avoid dead duplicate state.
    - Apply Zustand `immer` and `subscribeWithSelector` middleware per Requirement 22.
    - Outcome: the existing `useWizardStore` now owns a v1 `stepDrafts` schema, keeps adapter methods for existing step screens, and uses `subscribeWithSelector` plus an Immer-backed state updater.
    - _Requirements: 5 AC-1, 5 AC-2, 5 AC-3, 22 AC-1, 22 AC-2_

  - [x] 13.3 Add scoped storage identity and explicit persistence functions
    - Export `syncWizardDraftToStorage()` and `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage()` as standalone async functions.
    - Use tenant-scoped key `@novaclinics/{tenantId}/wizard_draft_v1`; fall back to `@novaclinics/user_{userId}/wizard_draft_v1` with `console.warn` when tenant ID is unavailable.
    - Keep storage reads/writes out of Zustand synchronous actions.
    - Outcome: storage is scoped by tenant, user, and schema version. `SetupWizardFlow` hydrates drafts on mount and debounces explicit storage sync from the existing store.
    - _Requirements: 5 AC-4, 22 AC-2, 30 AC-1, 30 AC-4_

  - [x] 13.4 Add safe hydration, migration, and corrupt-data handling
    - Validate parsed persisted data before restoring to memory.
    - Export `migrateDraft(fromVersion, toVersion, payload)` and `DraftMigrationError`.
    - Implement `v0 -> v1` migration for legacy split/raw draft payloads where data can be safely mapped.
    - Discard unsupported versions or corrupt payloads without throwing, log the error/warning, and remove the bad persisted entry.
    - Outcome: corrupt and incompatible scoped drafts are removed without crashing onboarding. Legacy v0 raw/split payloads migrate to unified `DraftEntry` where safe.
    - _Requirements: 5 AC-5, 5 AC-6, 5 AC-12_

  - [x] 13.5 Add size guard, compression, and recoverable sync errors
    - Define `MAX_DRAFT_SIZE_KB`.
    - Before persistence, compute serialized payload size.
    - Use `lz-string` `compressToUTF16` / `decompressFromUTF16` for oversized payloads.
    - If compressed payload is still too large or storage fails, log recoverably and emit the approved storage-failure event path.
    - Outcome: `immer` and `lz-string` are declared package dependencies. Oversized payloads are compressed; still-oversized or failed writes log and emit the console event path without throwing.
    - _Requirements: 5 AC-7, 5 AC-8_

  - [x] 13.6 Add tenant/user isolation and reset behavior
    - Ensure hydrate reads only the active tenant/user scoped key.
    - Ensure `reset()` clears memory and removes only the active scoped persisted entry.
    - Add logout/tenant-switch cleanup only if it can be done within existing auth/onboarding boundaries without changing lifecycle truth.
    - Outcome: hydrate validates tenant/user identity, tenant changes reset in-memory drafts, `resetWizardDraftStorage()` removes current scoped storage, and auth logout calls `clearWizardDraftStorageForIdentity()` before clearing local session.
    - _Requirements: 5 AC-11, 30 AC-1, 30 AC-2, 30 AC-3, 30 AC-5, 30 AC-7_

  - [x] 13.7 Add focused tests
    - Store schema: `setStepDraft` preserves `createdAt` and updates `lastSavedAt`.
    - Persistence round trip: `syncWizardDraftToStorage()` -> `reset()` -> `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage()` restores the original valid `stepDrafts`.
    - Tenant isolation: tenant A drafts never hydrate under tenant B; fallback user key is isolated.
    - Corrupt storage: hydration logs/removes corrupt entry and leaves empty drafts without throwing.
    - Migration: supported `v0 -> v1` payload migrates to unified `DraftEntry`; unsupported versions discard safely.
    - Size/compression: oversized payload uses compression; still-oversized payload skips write and reports approved failure event.
    - Reset/logout: scoped storage entry is removed without touching other tenants.
    - Outcome: `frontend/tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts` covers 12 focused draft persistence, migration, isolation, compression, and cleanup scenarios.
    - _Requirements: 5 AC-3 through AC-12, 15 AC-3, 15 AC-4, 30 AC-5, 30 AC-7_

  - [x] 13.8 Documentation and stop gate
    - Update this task group with implementation evidence, focused verification commands, and any resolved `OPEN_DECISION` outcomes.
    - Run `git diff --check`, focused `wizard.store` tests, and TypeScript verification for modified files if available.
    - Commit and push only reviewed files.
    - Stop for architectural review before beginning Requirement 6 step-screen integration.
    - Verification:
      - `npm test -- --runInBand tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts` passed: 1 suite, 12 tests.
      - `npm test -- --runInBand tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts` passed: 2 suites, 25 tests.
      - `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit --pretty false` still fails on existing baseline app-wide TypeScript debt; no Task Group 13 touched-file TypeScript errors remain.

  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Incomplete per-step drafts survive app restart for the same tenant/user.
    - Drafts do not hydrate across tenants, users, logout, or tenant switching.
    - Hydration never crashes on corrupt, unsupported, or oversized stored data.
    - Draft metadata is co-located with draft data and uses Unix millisecond timestamps.
    - Local draft state remains temporary input recovery only and does not mark onboarding steps complete.
    - Focused tests cover persistence, migration, corruption recovery, tenant/user isolation, and reset cleanup.

    - Backend draft synchronization.
    - Backend completion/readiness/lifecycle changes.
    - Activation eligibility or subscription policy changes.
    - Conflict resolution modal and `updated_at` backend contract.
    - Broad wizard rewrite.
    - Staging tenant/idempotency verification from Task 11.

### Progressive Experience Planning Reconciliation — Task Group 14

Outcome:

```text
TASK_GROUP_14_READY
```

Requirement 6 is the next valid implementation group. It depends on Task Group 13's v1 draft schema, explicit persistence, tenant/user isolation, and safe hydration. It is accepted in `requirements.md`, has sufficient support in the deferred design sections and dependency rules, has clear frontend ownership, can be implemented incrementally, and does not depend on Task 11 staging verification for implementation.

#### Candidate Area Review

| Candidate Area | Requirement Support | Design Support | Ownership Clear? | Dependencies Complete? | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wizard draft step-screen integration | Req 6; supports Req 10 AC-1 and future Req 16 | Deferred data flows, dependency rules, Task 13 store contract | Yes - frontend presentation + existing wizard store | Yes - Task 13 complete | SELECTED for Task Group 14 |
| OfflineBanner | Req 7, 15, 21, 24, 25 | Deferred component only | Mostly frontend | Partially - benefits from Req 6 first so offline changes preserve current step state | Defer until after Req 6 |
| PendingMutationStore/offline flush | Req 8, 30 | Deferred data models/flows only | Frontend store plus API retry behavior | No - needs offline banner, analytics/error decisions | Defer |
| App lifecycle | Req 9 | Deferred flow only | Frontend presentation + draft store | Partial - needs Req 6 current-step state integration | Defer until after Req 6 |
| Draft conflict modal | Req 16, 17, 25, 29 | Deferred component and DTO note | Frontend plus backend status contract | No - needs reliable step data integration and Req 29 decision | Defer |
| Demo/live transition wiring | Req 13, 26, 27 | Existing banner/component only, insufficient flow design | Frontend + subscription policy | Partial - subscription endpoint/extend-demo behavior unclear | Needs design clarification |
| Pending payment recovery | Req 18 | Requirement allows deferral to subscription spec | Frontend + subscription/payment | No - subscription/payment scope decision missing | Needs design clarification |
| Error centralisation | Req 20 | Deferred error handling only | Cross-cutting frontend | No - error mapping utility path/design unclear | Needs design clarification |
| Analytics/audit events | Req 28 | Deferred analytics stub note only | Core/frontend telemetry | No - event utility/provider decision missing | Needs design clarification |
| Backend `updated_at` contract | Req 29 | Design explicitly deferred | Backend + frontend DTO | No - backend contract/staging not verified | Defer |
| End-to-end release verification | Req 32 | Release checklist | Release/UAT | No - staging/device access required | Staging only |

#### Task 13 Follow-Up Mapping

Future Journey Versioning must not reuse draft schema versioning. When a future Journey Versioning task group is defined, it must include an acceptance item to review draft identity conceptually as:

```text
tenantId + userId + journeyVersion + draftSchemaVersion
```

The current Task 13 guarantees remain unchanged:

- fallback user drafts must not migrate to the wrong tenant;
- reset and logout cleanup remain scoped to the current tenant/user identity;
- local drafts never become completion truth.

Do not reopen Task Group 13 for this follow-up.

- [x] 14. Wizard Draft Step Screen Integration
  - This item was outside the earlier production-hardening checkpoint and is now authorized as a separate Progressive Experience implementation group.

  ## Objective

  Persist and restore actual per-step form input through the v1 draft store across all required onboarding step screens, while keeping backend onboarding status as the only completion truth.

  ## Requirement Traceability

  - Requirement 6 AC-1 through AC-5.
  - Requirement 10 AC-1 for saving current draft state before Android back navigation.
  - Requirement 14 AC-2 for restored-draft inline notice styling.
  - Requirement 15 AC-3 and AC-4 for draft tests where applicable.
  - Requirement 21 AC-1 for no hardcoded style values in modified UI.
  - Requirement 22 AC-4 and AC-5 for store subscription/use boundaries.
  - Requirement 23 AC-4 for presentation orchestration.
  - Requirement 24 AC-1, AC-2, AC-4 for new user-visible copy.
  - Requirement 25 AC-4 for disabled/restored-state accessibility where touched.

  ## Design Traceability

  - `design.md` deferred data flows for draft lifecycle.
  - `design.md` dependency rules for stores, presentation hooks, repositories, and components.
  - `design.md` theme compliance.
  - `tasks.md` Task Group 13 store contract and evidence.

  ## Ownership

  - Owning layer: frontend onboarding presentation layer.
  - Collaborating module: existing onboarding wizard store at `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/stores/wizard.store.ts`.
  - Must not own backend completion truth, onboarding readiness, lifecycle state, activation eligibility, subscription policy, or server-side synchronization.
  - Must not create another wizard/draft store.

  ## Dependencies

  - Recovery Checkpoint R0: complete.
  - Task Groups 1-10: complete.
  - Task 11.0 implementation and automated verification: complete.
  - Task Group 13: complete; v1 draft schema, scoped storage, safe hydration, migration, expiry, and focused tests are available.
  - Task 11.1 and 11.2 staging checks remain release blockers only; they do not block Task 14 implementation.

  ## Existing Assets to Reuse

  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/stores/wizard.store.ts`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/SetupWizardFlow.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/ClinicProfileScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/OperatingHoursScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/TreatmentRoomsScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/StaffSetupScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/BillingSetupScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/PaymentSetupScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/en-US.json`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/hi-IN.json`

  ## Tasks

  - [x] 14.1 Inventory current step-screen draft behavior
    - Confirm which required screens already call `useWizardStore` and which do not.
    - Record existing submit handlers, restore paths, and server-data fetch behavior.
    - Confirm no screen treats a local draft as completion state.

  - [x] 14.2 Add a reusable presentation helper for step drafts if it reduces duplication
    - Prefer a small hook/helper only if it removes repeated debounce/restore/clear logic.
    - Keep it in the onboarding presentation boundary.
    - Do not move API or React Query behavior into the store.

  - [x] 14.3 Integrate draft save/restore in required step screens
    - Cover `ClinicProfileScreen`, `OperatingHoursScreen`, `TreatmentRoomsScreen`, `StaffSetupScreen`, `BillingSetupScreen`, and `PaymentSetupScreen`.
    - Save current form state through `setStepDraft(stepCode, currentFormState)` with approximately 500 ms debounce.
    - Restore drafts only when server-side data for that step is absent or stale.
    - Do not restore drafts for completed server steps unless a future conflict-resolution group explicitly authorizes it.

  - [x] 14.4 Clear drafts after successful submission
    - After each step's successful submit, call `clearStepDraft(stepCode)` and persist the resulting store state.
    - Preserve current `onSuccess` and wizard navigation behavior.
    - Do not mark a step complete locally.

  - [x] 14.5 Add restored-draft inline indicator
    - Add localized copy for "Restored unsaved changes" in English and Hindi.
    - Use `useClinicTheme()` values only.
    - Indicator is non-dismissible and clears when the user edits the form or submits.
    - Include accessibility state/role only where appropriate for the existing UI pattern.

  - [x] 14.6 Save current draft before Android back previous-step navigation
    - Ensure the registered current-step save handler or equivalent draft sync runs before `handlePrevious` changes step.
    - Preserve the existing guarantee that Android hardware back never exits the wizard.

  - [x] 14.7 Focused tests
    - Unit/integration tests for draft restore and clear-on-submit for representative screens.
    - Verify restored indicator behavior.
    - Verify a completed backend step is not overridden by a local draft.
    - Verify Android back saves/syncs current draft before moving to the previous step.
    - Keep existing Task 13 store tests passing.

  - [x] 14.8 Documentation and stop gate
    - Update Task Group 14 evidence and verification commands in this file.
    - Run `git diff --check`, focused onboarding tests, and TypeScript verification for touched files where applicable.
    - Commit and push only reviewed files.
    - Stop for architectural review before any offline or conflict-resolution work.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - Required step screens save incomplete form data into the v1 draft store.
  - Drafts restore only for the same tenant/user and only when backend data is absent or stale.
  - Successful submit clears the corresponding local draft.
  - Restored-draft UI is localized, theme-compliant, and does not block interaction.
  - Android back to a previous step preserves current local edits before navigation.
  - Local drafts never mark onboarding steps complete.

  ## Likely Files

  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/SetupWizardFlow.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/ClinicProfileScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/OperatingHoursScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/TreatmentRoomsScreen.tsx`

  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts`
  - `frontend/core/localization/locales/en-US.json`
  - `frontend/core/localization/locales/hi-IN.json`

  Backend files: `UNKNOWN`; no backend change is expected for Task Group 14.

  ## Tests

  - Focused step-screen tests for save/restore/clear behavior.
  - `SetupWizardFlow` integration test for Android back draft save before previous-step navigation.
  - Existing Task Group 13 wizard store tests.
  - TypeScript verification for touched files if available.

  ## Migration Fixtures

  Reuse the migration-fixture concepts for:

  - onboarding/provisional tenant with `tenant_id` available or fallback user identity;
  - live tenant with tenant-scoped draft keys;
  - tenant switching without draft leakage;
  - Hindi localization key audit for new restored-draft copy.

  No database migration is authorized.

  ## Localization

  - No hardcoded user-facing strings.
  - Add restored-draft indicator keys to English and Hindi locale files.
  - Preserve interpolation parity if interpolation is introduced.

  ## Non-Goals

  - Offline banner.
  - Pending mutation queue.
  - Axios retry interceptor.
  - Draft conflict modal.
  - Backend `updated_at` contract.
  - Multi-device conflict resolution.
  - Analytics beyond existing Task 13 draft-store event path.
  - Payment recovery.
  - Subscription/demo transition policy.
  - Staging tenant/idempotency verification.
  - Journey Versioning or journey-aware draft keys.

  ## Stop Gate

  After implementation: focused verification, canonical docs update, commit, push, architectural review, and no automatic continuation.

  ## Completion Evidence

  - Reused the Task Group 13 v1 `wizard.store.ts` schema, tenant/user scoped hydration, persistence, migration, cleanup, and expiry behavior.
  - Added `clearStepDraftAndSync(stepCode)` to clear only the completed step draft and immediately persist the updated store.
  - Added `RestoredDraftIndicator` as a localized, theme-based presentation component.
  - Integrated draft save/restore/clear behavior in `ClinicProfileScreen`, `OperatingHoursScreen`, `TreatmentRoomsScreen`, `StaffSetupScreen`, `BillingSetupScreen`, and `PaymentSetupScreen`.
  - Updated `SetupWizardFlow` so Android previous-step navigation awaits draft storage sync before changing steps and go-live completion clears all wizard drafts.
  - Added English and Hindi restored-draft keys in the actual translation files under `frontend/core/localization/translations/`.
  - Focused verification passed:
    - `git diff --check`
    - `npx jest tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx tests/onboarding/PaymentSetupScreen.draft.test.tsx --runInBand`
  - TypeScript verification was executed with `npx tsc --noEmit`; Task Group 14 touched onboarding files had no reported TypeScript errors after filtering, while the full command still reports unrelated baseline failures in existing non-Task-14 files.

### Progressive Experience Planning Reconciliation — Task Group 15

Outcome:

```text
TASK_GROUP_15_READY
```

Task Group 15 selects Requirement 9 because Task Group 14 has completed per-step draft integration, giving `SetupWizardFlow` a reliable in-memory draft state to flush when the app backgrounds. This is the smallest dependency-correct increment after draft persistence: it improves real user data safety, uses existing React Native `AppState`, does not require new platform work, and does not require reopening completed routing, idempotency, tenant, or draft-store architecture.

#### Updated Requirements Coverage Matrix

#### Candidate Area Review

| Candidate Area | Readiness | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| App lifecycle draft/status sync | Requirements are explicit in Req 9; Task 14 completed current draft persistence; uses existing `AppState`, `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage`, `syncWizardDraftToStorage`, and `refetch`. | SELECTED for Task Group 15. |
| OfflineBanner | Req 7 is explicit, but NetInfo is not declared and Req 8 would still be needed for CTA gating. | BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY for now; better after lifecycle sync or an offline dependency/install group. |
| Pending mutation handling | Req 8 is broad and introduces a new store, retry/dead-letter logic, analytics, and tenant isolation obligations. | BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY on OfflineBanner, analytics/error decisions, and architecture review. |
| Error recovery / centralised onboarding errors | Req 20 is valuable, but design does not yet identify the onboarding mapper boundary or exact integration pattern. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Analytics/audit events | Req 28 lacks an approved telemetry provider; existing analytics feature is reporting-oriented, not an event emitter. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Draft conflict modal | Depends on foreground resume behavior and Req 29 timestamp contract/fallback. | BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY until Task 15 and Req 29 decision. |
| Journey Cards | Not represented by an accepted concrete requirement or design in the current canonical docs. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Journey Versioning | Preserved as a Task 13 follow-up, but no requirement/design group is accepted yet. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Capability-driven visibility | Ownership map identifies Capability ownership, but current tasks do not define an implementable capability visibility increment. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Workspace preparation | Ownership is Workspace, but no next implementable design slice is present in these docs. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Readiness providers | Backend/readiness ownership is not decomposed into a frontend-safe task group here. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Ready-to-Start experience | `GoLiveScreen` exists and uses server step status; remaining gaps overlap demo/live and completion lifecycle. | BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY on trial/subscription policy decisions. |
| Trial lifecycle UX | `DemoStatusBanner` exists, but SetupWizardFlow wiring and commercial policy are incomplete. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION before implementation. |
| Commercial trial conversion | Existing repository hooks exist, but subscription/commercial policy is not fully specified for the next slice. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Informational dunning | No accepted requirement/design currently defines dunning behavior. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Billing preparation / progressive financial setup | Billing and payment step screens exist; pending payment recovery and subscription verification remain underspecified. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Clinic identity refinements | Clinic profile screen exists and drafts are integrated; no accepted next refinements are specified. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Clinic contact improvements | Covered only by existing clinic profile behavior; no standalone accepted task is defined. | NEEDS_DESIGN_CLARIFICATION. |
| Backend `updated_at` contract | Frontend DTO has `updated_at`, but backend/staging guarantee is not verified. | BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY for conflict-resolution work. |
| End-to-end release verification | Requires staging URL, credentials, safe tenants, and physical-device/network checks. | STAGING_ONLY, not an implementation group. |

- [x] 15. App Lifecycle Draft Sync and Foreground Status Refresh

  ## Objective

  Preserve in-progress onboarding work across app background/foreground transitions by flushing current draft state to persistent storage when the app backgrounds, hydrating drafts when the app returns active, refetching authoritative onboarding status, and showing a localized inline notice when the server-visible step list changed while the app was away.

  ## User Value

  A clinic admin can switch apps, answer a call, or briefly lose focus mid-form without losing local edits or unknowingly continuing from a stale step list after returning.

  ## Requirement Traceability

  - Requirement 9 AC-1 through AC-3.
  - Requirement 6 AC-5, because lifecycle hydration must reuse the existing draft hydration contract.
  - Requirement 10 AC-1, because background and hardware-back persistence should remain consistent.
  - Requirement 14 AC-2 and Requirement 21 AC-1 for theme-compliant inline notice styling.
  - Requirement 15 AC-3 and AC-4 for focused lifecycle tests.
  - Requirement 22 AC-4 and AC-5 for wizard-store subscription/use boundaries.
  - Requirement 23 AC-4 for presentation orchestration.
  - Requirement 24 AC-1, AC-2, AC-4 for any new user-visible copy.
  - Requirement 25 AC-4 for non-blocking notice accessibility where appropriate.

  ## Design Traceability

  - `design.md` deferred AppState lifecycle handling.
  - `design.md` dependency rules for presentation orchestration and store side effects.
  - `tasks.md` Task Group 13 store contract.
  - `tasks.md` Task Group 14 screen-level draft integration.

  ## Ownership

  - Owning layer: frontend onboarding presentation layer.
  - Collaborating module: existing onboarding wizard store at `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/stores/wizard.store.ts`.
  - `SetupWizardFlow` may orchestrate lifecycle events, draft hydration/sync, and onboarding status refetch.
  - Backend status remains authoritative for step completion and readiness.
  - Must not create a new store, own readiness policy, own subscription policy, or introduce conflict-resolution behavior.

  ## Dependencies

  Implementation dependencies:

  - Recovery Checkpoint R0: complete.
  - Task Groups 1-10: complete.
  - Task 11.0 implementation and automated verification: complete.
  - Task Group 13: complete.
  - Task Group 14: complete.

  Staging dependencies:

  - None for implementation.
  - Existing Task 11.1 and 11.2 staging checks remain required before integration/promotion.

  Release dependencies:

  - Baseline frontend Jest/TypeScript debt remains a release/integration blocker.
  - Staging tenant/replay verification remains a production promotion blocker.

  ## Existing Components to Reuse

  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/SetupWizardFlow.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/stores/wizard.store.ts`
  - `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage()`
  - `syncWizardDraftToStorage()`
  - `useWizardStore`
  - `useOnboardingStatusQuery`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/en-US.json`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/hi-IN.json`

  Backend files: not expected.

  ## Work Breakdown

  - [x] 15.1 Inventory lifecycle baseline
    - Confirm current `SetupWizardFlow` mount hydration, draft sync subscription, Android back sync, and status `refetch` behavior.
    - Record the active step-list comparison source (`visible_steps` or derived step code list).

  - [x] 15.2 Add AppState lifecycle orchestration in `SetupWizardFlow`
    - Register and clean up a React Native `AppState` listener while the wizard is mounted.
    - On transition to background/inactive, ensure current draft state has been pushed into the v1 draft store through Task 14 screen integration, then call `syncWizardDraftToStorage()`.
    - Do not submit any backend mutation from the lifecycle handler.

  - [x] 15.3 Hydrate and refetch on foreground resume
    - On transition to active, call `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage()`.
    - Then call onboarding status `refetch()` when `tenantId` and authentication state are valid.
    - Preserve the existing focus-effect guard so logout/unauthenticated transitions do not fire authenticated requests.

  - [x] 15.4 Show updated-steps notice when server step list changes
    - Compare the step-code signature before backgrounding with the post-refetch `visible_steps` signature.
    - If the list changed, show a non-blocking localized inline notice that setup steps were updated.
    - Use `useClinicTheme()` values only.
    - Notice clears when the user changes steps, exits, or the wizard receives another unchanged active-state refetch.

  - [x] 15.5 Focused tests
    - Verify background transition calls `syncWizardDraftToStorage()`.
    - Verify active transition calls `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage()` and then `refetch()`.
    - Verify no active refetch occurs when unauthenticated or tenant ID is absent.
    - Verify the updated-steps notice appears when `visible_steps` changes after foreground refetch.
    - Verify the notice does not appear when the step list is unchanged.

  - [x] 15.6 Documentation and stop gate
    - Update Task Group 15 evidence and verification commands in this file.
    - Run `git diff --check`, focused lifecycle tests, and TypeScript verification for touched files where applicable.
    - Commit and push only reviewed files.
    - Stop for architectural review before offline, pending mutation, or conflict-resolution work.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - Background/inactive app transitions persist current onboarding drafts through the existing wizard draft storage.
  - Foreground active transitions hydrate local drafts and refetch authoritative onboarding status in that order.
  - Lifecycle handlers do not submit step data, complete onboarding, transition demo/live status, or mutate subscription state.
  - A localized, theme-compliant inline notice appears only when the server-visible step list changed while the app was away.
  - Backend status remains the only completion/readiness truth.
  - Lifecycle listeners are removed on unmount.

  ## Localization

  - No hardcoded user-facing strings.
  - Add English and Hindi keys for the updated-steps notice.
  - Preserve interpolation parity if interpolation is introduced.

  ## Tests

  - Focused `SetupWizardFlow` lifecycle tests for background sync, foreground hydrate/refetch, unchanged step list, changed step list, and unauthenticated/tenant-missing guards.
  - Existing Task Group 13 and Task Group 14 draft tests remain in scope if touched.
  - TypeScript verification for touched files if available.

  ## Migration Fixtures

  Reuse the migration-fixture concepts for:

  - onboarding/provisional tenant with a tenant ID or safe fallback identity;
  - live tenant with tenant-scoped draft keys;
  - tenant switching without draft leakage;
  - Hindi localization key parity for the new notice.

  No database migration is authorized.

  ## Non-Goals

  - Offline banner.
  - NetInfo dependency installation.
  - Pending mutation queue.
  - Axios retry interceptor.
  - Draft conflict modal.
  - Multi-device conflict resolution.
  - Backend `updated_at` contract.
  - Analytics beyond existing console fallback paths.
  - Payment recovery.
  - Subscription/demo transition policy.
  - Journey Versioning or journey-aware draft keys.

  ## Stop Gate

  After implementation: focused verification, canonical docs update, commit, push, architectural review, and no automatic continuation.

  ## Completion Evidence

  - Added `AppState` lifecycle orchestration in `SetupWizardFlow`.
  - Background/inactive transitions record the current `visible_steps` signature and call `syncWizardDraftToStorage()` only when the existing wizard store is dirty.
  - Foreground active transitions call `hydrateWizardDraftFromStorage()` and then guarded onboarding status `refetch()` when tenant/auth state is valid.
  - Added a localized, theme-based inline notice for changed server-visible step lists after foreground refresh.
  - Kept backend onboarding status authoritative; lifecycle handlers do not submit step data, complete onboarding, transition demo/live state, mutate subscriptions, poll, or schedule background work.
  - Updated `syncWizardDraftToStorage()` to mark the existing wizard store clean after successful raw or compressed persistence.
  - Added English and Hindi `progressUpdatedNotice` localization keys.
  - Focused verification passed:
    - `git diff --check`
    - `npx jest tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts --runInBand`
  - TypeScript verification was executed with `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`; the command still reports existing baseline failures outside Task Group 15 touched files, including existing onboarding demo-status usecase DTO mismatches.

### Progressive Experience Planning Reconciliation - TG16

Outcome:

```text
TASK_GROUP_16_READY
```

TG16 selects offline connectivity visibility and submit gating because Task Groups 13-15 now preserve local drafts across editing, navigation, and app lifecycle transitions. The next smallest dependency-safe increment is to prevent users from submitting while the device is known offline and to make that state visible. Pending mutation persistence, retry/flush, and dead-letter handling remain broader follow-up work because they require a new queue store, network replay policy, structured analytics, and error-recovery decisions.

#### Offline Sequencing Decision

Offline behavior is now the correct next area only for a bounded visibility/gating increment. Req 7 mandates an offline banner, and Req 8 AC1 requires disabling submit CTAs while offline. The design does not yet define network-state ownership for a durable mutation queue, and no `PendingMutationStore` exists. Backend platform idempotency makes replay safer once a request reaches the server, but it does not by itself define local offline queue semantics. TG16 must therefore stop at network-state detection, banner visibility, and submit/complete gating; mutation queueing, retry flush, and dead-letter UX remain future work.

#### Task Group 16 - Offline Connectivity Banner and Submit Gating

- [x] 16. Offline Connectivity Banner and Submit Gating

  ## Objective

  Make offline state visible in the onboarding wizard and prevent known-offline submit actions from dispatching backend mutations.

  ## User Value

  A clinic admin on an unreliable connection can see why onboarding cannot submit right now, keep editing safely through existing draft persistence, and avoid failed or misleading submit attempts while offline.

  ## Requirement Traceability

  - Requirement 7 AC1-6.
  - Requirement 8 AC1 and the online re-enable portion of AC2.
  - Requirement 14 AC1-2.
  - Requirement 15 AC1-2.
  - Requirement 24 AC1-4.
  - Requirement 25 AC1 and AC4.
  - Requirement 26 AC1 and AC4 for preserving submit disabled/loading behavior.

  ## Design Traceability

  - `design.md` Deferred Components: `OfflineBanner.tsx`.
  - `design.md` Layer Map: presentation components own UI state, repositories own server mutations.
  - `design.md` Dependency Rules: presentation may orchestrate hooks/components; no direct API calls.
  - `design.md` Theme Compliance.
  - `design.md` Testing Strategy: offline banner and CTA disabled coverage.

  ## Ownership

  - Owning layer: frontend onboarding presentation.
  - Collaborators: React Native NetInfo, `SetupWizardFlow`, existing submit/complete pending-state logic, localization, theme.
  - Owns: network-state display, offline CTA disabled state, and accessible user feedback.
  - Must not own: mutation execution, server completion truth, readiness, subscription policy, retry scheduling, background sync, or queued mutation replay.

  ## Dependencies

  Implementation dependencies:

  - Recovery Checkpoint R0 complete.
  - Task Groups 13-15 complete.
  - Platform idempotency implemented in backend dev branch.
  - Existing draft persistence and lifecycle sync protect local edits while offline.

  Staging dependencies:

  - None for implementation.
  - Physical/emulated offline validation remains part of release verification.

  Release dependencies:

  - Task 11 staging tenant/replay checks remain open.
  - Baseline frontend Jest/TypeScript debt remains an integration blocker.
  - Req 32 Run D remains required before production promotion.

  ## Existing Assets to Reuse

  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/SetupWizardFlow.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/components/RestoredDraftIndicator.tsx` as a local theme/i18n/accessibility pattern.
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/en-US.json`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/hi-IN.json`
  - Existing `isNextPending`, `isHandlingNext`, `submitMutation.isPending`, and `accessibilityState` patterns.

  Backend files: not expected.

  ## Work Breakdown

  - [x] 16.1 Confirm NetInfo dependency approach
    - Add `@react-native-community/netinfo` using the repository package manager only if it remains absent.
    - Do not add a custom network service or global offline engine.
    - Completion evidence: repository had no existing NetInfo dependency or onboarding connectivity abstraction; `@react-native-community/netinfo` was added with Yarn only.

  - [x] 16.2 Add `OfflineBanner`
    - Create `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/components/OfflineBanner.tsx`.
    - Use NetInfo connectivity state.
    - Render nothing when online or unknown.
    - Render a non-blocking themed alert when offline.
    - Completion evidence: `OfflineBanner` renders a localized, themed alert only when `isOffline` is true.

  - [x] 16.3 Wire offline state into `SetupWizardFlow`
    - Render `OfflineBanner` near existing wizard notices.
    - Disable `Next`, `Previous` only if needed to preserve submit safety, and `Ready to Start`/complete actions that would dispatch backend mutations while offline.
    - Preserve existing pending-state spinner and stale-submission guards.
    - Do not enqueue or replay mutations.
    - Completion evidence: `SetupWizardFlow` gates backend mutation CTAs when NetInfo reports known offline, preserves editing/navigation, and does not add queue/retry/replay behavior.

  - [x] 16.4 Localize and preserve accessibility
    - Add English and Hindi keys for banner copy and any offline-disabled label if needed.
    - Set banner `accessibilityRole="alert"` and `accessibilityLiveRegion="polite"`.
    - Ensure disabled CTAs set `accessibilityState={{ disabled: true }}`.
    - Completion evidence: English and Hindi offline keys were added; banner and disabled CTA accessibility states are covered in focused tests.

  - [x] 16.5 Focused tests
    - Mock NetInfo online/offline states.
    - Verify banner renders offline and not online.
    - Verify `Next`/submit CTA is disabled offline and enabled online.
    - Verify pressing disabled submit does not call mutation.
    - Verify pending submit behavior still disables and shows spinner.
    - Completion evidence: `npx jest tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx tests/onboarding/wizard.store.test.ts --runInBand --silent` passed with 2 suites and 37 tests.

  - [x] 16.6 Documentation and stop gate
    - Update this task with completion evidence.
    - Run `git diff --check`, focused onboarding tests, and TypeScript verification for touched files if practical.
    - Commit, push, and stop for architectural review before Task Group 17.
    - Completion evidence: `git diff --check` passed. `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` was executed; it remains blocked by baseline TypeScript errors outside Task Group 16 touched files, with no errors reported for `OfflineBanner`, `SetupWizardFlow`, localization files, or package metadata.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - Offline state displays a localized, non-blocking `OfflineBanner`.
  - Online or unknown network state does not render the banner.
  - Known-offline state disables submit/complete CTAs that would dispatch backend mutations.
  - Existing draft editing, draft persistence, lifecycle sync, and status display continue to work while offline.
  - No pending mutation queue, retry scheduler, background service, polling, or backend endpoint is introduced.
  - No hardcoded user-facing text is added.
  - New UI uses `useClinicTheme()` tokens only.

  ## Likely Files

  - `frontend/package.json`
  - `frontend/yarn.lock`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/components/OfflineBanner.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/SetupWizardFlow.tsx`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/en-US.json`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/hi-IN.json`

  Backend files: not expected.

  ## Tests

  - Offline banner visible when NetInfo reports disconnected.
  - Offline banner hidden when NetInfo reports connected.
  - `Next`/submit CTA disabled while offline.
  - Offline submit press does not dispatch `useSubmitStepMutation`.
  - Online submit behavior remains unchanged.
  - Existing Task Groups 13-15 focused tests remain in scope if touched.

  ## Localization

  - Add English and Hindi keys for offline banner copy.
  - No hardcoded user-visible strings.
  - Preserve key parity and interpolation parity.

  ## Migration Fixtures

  - Demo/provisional tenant with draft edits while offline.
  - Live tenant with draft edits while offline.
  - Tenant switching must not affect existing draft storage behavior.
  - No database migration.

  ## Non-Goals

  - PendingMutationStore.
  - Offline mutation queue.
  - Retry flush.
  - Axios retry interceptor.
  - Dead-letter handling.
  - Analytics events.
  - Draft conflict modal.
  - Backend `updated_at` contract.
  - Journey Versioning.
  - Payment recovery.
  - Subscription/demo policy changes.
  - Background sync, polling, timers, push notifications, or websocket refresh.

  ## Preserved Follow-Ups

  - Draft schema version is not Journey Version.
  - Future Journey Versioning must review draft identity.
  - Foreground refresh must not evolve into polling.
  - Lifecycle listeners must remain singular and scoped.
  - Drafts must never become completion truth.

  ## Stop Gate

  After implementation: focused verification, canonical docs update, commit, push, architectural review, and no automatic continuation to Task Group 17.

### Progressive Experience Planning Reconciliation - TG17

Outcome:

```text
TASK_GROUP_17_READY
```

Task Group 17 selects DemoStatusBanner action wiring because it is the next visible customer-value increment with verified local assets and no new backend ownership. It uses the existing banner, demo-status query, transition API, repository hook pattern, theme, localization, and wizard orchestration. It intentionally stops at wiring the banner actions and preserving the existing go-live checklist gate; it does not implement subscription conversion, payment recovery, readiness policy, pending mutation queues, analytics, or backend contract changes.

#### Task Group 17 - DemoStatusBanner Action Wiring and Go-Live Checklist Routing

- [x] 17. DemoStatusBanner Action Wiring and Go-Live Checklist Routing

  ## Objective

  Wire the legacy compatibility banner actions into `SetupWizardFlow` so users can continue setup or move intentionally to the existing Ready-to-Start checklist gate without bypassing readiness, subscription, or backend ownership.

  ## User Value

  A clinic admin sees actionable banner controls instead of dead UI. "Ready to Start" guides them to the checklist step, and "Continue Setup" returns them to the backend-recommended preparation step.

  ## Requirement Traceability

  - Requirement 13 AC1-6.
  - Requirement 14 AC3-4 for touched banner/wizard styling.
  - Requirement 15 AC6 for preserving existing wizard tests.
  - Requirement 24 AC1-4 for new user-visible strings.
  - Requirement 25 AC3 for touched CTA accessibility.
  - Requirement 26 AC3-4 for pending transition button state.
  - Requirement 27 AC3-4 for demo/live query invalidation and session refresh planning.

  ## Design Traceability

  - `design.md` Layer Map: repository hooks own React Query mutations; presentation orchestrates.
  - `design.md` Dependency Rules: presentation must not call datasources directly; repositories must not import Zustand directly.
  - `design.md` Query Invalidation Rules.
  - `design.md` Theme Compliance.
  - `design.md` Backend Dependencies for E2E Validation.

  ## Ownership

  Frontend responsibilities:

  - use existing repository query data to determine whether the compatibility banner can render;
  - wire `DemoStatusBanner` props from `SetupWizardFlow`;
  - route "Ready to Start" to the existing `go_live_checklist` step instead of directly transitioning the tenant;
  - route "Continue Setup" to the backend-recommended step when available;
  - keep touched CTA accessibility states accurate.

  Backend responsibilities:

  - preserve existing demo-status and transition endpoint contracts;
  - no backend code is expected for this task group.

  Must not own:

  - subscription conversion;
  - payment recovery;
  - commercial pricing or plan policy;
  - readiness eligibility computation;
  - workspace lifecycle;
  - offline mutation queueing;
  - analytics provider implementation;
  - backend idempotency or tenant-resolution redesign.

  ## Dependencies

  Implementation dependencies:

  - Recovery Checkpoint R0 complete.
  - Task Groups 13-16 complete.
  - Existing `DemoStatusBanner` component.
  - Existing `useDemoStatusQuery`.
  - Existing `go_live_checklist` step handling in `SetupWizardFlow`.

  Staging dependencies:

  - None for implementation.
  - Staging demo/live endpoint verification remains required before integration or production promotion.

  Release dependencies:

  - Task 11 staging tenant/replay checks remain open.
  - Production promotion remains `NO-GO`.
  - Baseline frontend Jest/TypeScript debt remains an integration blocker.
  - Req 32 E2E runs must include the demo banner path before release.

  ## Existing Components to Reuse

  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/components/DemoStatusBanner.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/SetupWizardFlow.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/steps/GoLiveScreen.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/data/repositories/onboarding.repository.impl.ts`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/data/datasources/onboarding.api.ts`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/data/models/onboarding.dtos.ts`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/DemoStatusBanner.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/onboarding.repository.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/en-US.json`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/hi-IN.json`

  Backend files: not expected.

  ## Work Breakdown

  - [x] 17.1 Audit current demo/live flow
    - Confirm how `SetupWizardFlow` identifies PROVISIONAL/demo tenants from current status/auth data.
    - Confirm whether `go_live_checklist` exists in `visible_steps`; if not, document fallback behavior before implementation.
    - Do not infer commercial policy from UI labels.
    - Completion evidence: no reliable frontend lifecycle flag exists beyond existing auth/onboarding status and demo-status data. The banner renders only when the existing demo-status query returns data. Ready-to-Start navigation is disabled unless backend-provided `go_live_checklist` is present and actionable.

  - [x] 17.2 Preserve repository boundaries
    - Do not add a banner-owned mutation because TG17 banner actions are presentation-only and must not activate tenant, workspace, subscription, or commercial trial state.
    - Use `useDemoStatusQuery` for compatibility banner data.
    - Do not call `transitionDemoToLiveApi` from `SetupWizardFlow`.
    - Completion evidence: no repository or datasource changes were made; banner actions only update the current wizard step index.

  - [x] 17.3 Wire `DemoStatusBanner` in `SetupWizardFlow`
    - Render the banner only when existing demo-status data is available.
    - Wire `onExtendDemo` compatibility prop to route to the backend-recommended preparation step.
    - Wire `onTransitionToLive` to navigate to the existing `go_live_checklist` step.
    - Preserve offline gating and existing submit/complete pending behavior.
    - Completion evidence: `SetupWizardFlow` renders the legacy compatibility banner from `useDemoStatusQuery`, routes Continue Setup to `next_recommended_step`, and routes Ready to Start to `go_live_checklist` only when backend status marks it actionable.

  - [x] 17.4 Pending, localization, and accessibility
    - Disable touched banner CTAs while their mutation/navigation action is pending.
    - Add localized English and Hindi user-facing copy.
    - Use `useClinicTheme()` for all new visual states.
    - Add accessibility state/labels for disabled banner CTAs.
    - Completion evidence: banner labels now use Ready-to-Start terminology, disable state is exposed through `accessibilityState`, and English/Hindi strings avoid user-facing Demo and Go Live lifecycle terms.

  - [x] 17.5 Focused tests
    - Repository boundary regression coverage confirms no direct activation mutation is dispatched from banner actions.
    - `SetupWizardFlow` tests for banner rendering in demo context.
    - `SetupWizardFlow` tests that Ready to Start routes to `go_live_checklist` without calling transition API.
    - `DemoStatusBanner` tests for disabled/pending CTA states if the component API changes.
    - Completion evidence: `npx jest tests/onboarding/DemoStatusBanner.test.tsx tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx tests/onboarding/onboarding.repository.test.tsx --runInBand --silent --forceExit` reported 3 passed suites and 42 passed tests. `--forceExit` is still required because of existing Jest open-handle debt.

  - [x] 17.6 Documentation and stop gate
    - Update this task with completion evidence.
    - Run `git diff --check`, focused onboarding tests, and TypeScript verification for touched files if practical.
    - Commit, push, and stop for architectural review before Task Group 18.
    - Completion evidence: `git diff --check` passed. `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false` was executed and still reports existing baseline failures outside TG17 touched files.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  - Compatibility wizard sessions render `DemoStatusBanner` when demo status data is available.
  - "Continue Setup" routes only within the existing wizard step list.
  - "Ready to Start" navigates to `go_live_checklist` and does not directly transition or complete the tenant.
  - Pending banner actions disable the relevant CTA and expose `accessibilityState={{ disabled: true }}`.
  - User-facing banner copy is localized and does not expose Demo or Go Live lifecycle terms.
  - No direct datasource calls are added to presentation.
  - No backend files are modified.

  ## Likely Files

  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/components/DemoStatusBanner.tsx`
  - `frontend/features/onboarding/presentation/pages/SetupWizardFlow.tsx`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/DemoStatusBanner.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/tests/onboarding/SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/en-US.json`
  - `frontend/core/localization/translations/hi-IN.json`

  Backend files: not expected.

  Unknown paths:

  ```text
  UNKNOWN
  ```

  No additional paths are authorized until implementation inspection confirms them.

  ## Tests

  - Banner renders only when compatibility demo-status data is available.
  - Continue Setup routes to the backend-recommended step.
  - Ready-to-start action navigates to `go_live_checklist`.
  - Ready-to-start action does not dispatch a submit/transition mutation.
  - Ready-to-start action is disabled when backend status marks the checklist not actionable.
  - Existing offline gating tests still pass.

  ## Localization

  - Update English and Hindi banner values to Progressive Experience terminology.
  - No hardcoded user-visible strings.
  - Preserve key parity and interpolation parity.

  ## Migration Fixtures

  - Demo/provisional tenant with active sample access.
  - Demo/provisional tenant with expired sample access but active commercial trial.
  - Demo/provisional tenant where `go_live_checklist` exists in `visible_steps`.
  - Demo/provisional tenant where `go_live_checklist` is absent; implementation must not invent a step.
  - No database migration.

  ## Non-Goals

  - Subscription checkout implementation.
  - Pending payment recovery.
  - Pricing, dunning, or commercial policy.
  - Direct tenant transition from the banner.
  - Workspace lifecycle changes.
  - Readiness provider changes.
  - Offline queue/retry/replay.
  - Centralized onboarding error mapper.
  - Analytics provider or event emission.
  - Backend API changes.
  - Doctor Module work.

  ## Stop Gate

  After implementation: focused verification, canonical docs update, commit, push, architectural review, and no automatic continuation to Task Group 18.

### Post-Dev-Sync Reconciliation - 2026-07-20

Outcome:

```text
NO_IMPLEMENTATION_GROUP_READY
```

The frontend and backend `feature/progressive-experience-recovery` worktrees were synchronized with latest `origin/dev` before this reconciliation. Frontend HEAD is `516dc8feb780460481310295b20920e38977ee15`; backend HEAD is `14522967f8a063b53b7f29c0b2b8e9cbc750b573`. Both worktrees are clean, both remain on `feature/progressive-experience-recovery`, and `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/dev HEAD` returned `0` in both repositories.

Task Group 17 remains complete after the dev merge. The next incomplete areas are either staging-only release checks or implementation areas with unresolved design, ownership, backend contract, telemetry, payment, or environment dependencies. No Task Group 18 is authorized from the current canonical evidence.

#### Task Group 17 Evidence Audit

| Task 17 Acceptance Item | Code Evidence | Test Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compatibility wizard sessions render `DemoStatusBanner` when demo status data is available. | `SetupWizardFlow.tsx` calls `useDemoStatusQuery(tenantId, { enabled: !!tenantId && currentUser?.applicationStatus === \"onboarding\" })` and renders `DemoStatusBanner` only when `demoStatusData` exists. | `SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx` covers banner rendering with mocked demo status data; focused TG17 run reported 3 passed suites and 42 passed tests. | VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| "Continue Setup" routes only within the existing wizard step list. | `handleContinueSetupFromBanner` first uses `statusData.next_recommended_step` through `navigateToStep`, then falls back to an existing non-completed/non-blocked step. `navigateToStep` returns false for unknown step codes. | `SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx` verifies Continue Setup routes to the backend-recommended `operating_hours` step and does not dispatch a mutation. | VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| "Ready to Start" navigates to `go_live_checklist` and does not directly transition or complete the tenant. | `handleReadyToStartFromBanner` only calls `navigateToStep(\"go_live_checklist\")` when `canOpenReadyToStartChecklist` is true. No banner-owned transition mutation or tenant completion call is added. | `SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx` verifies Ready to Start opens the existing checklist and `mockMutateAsync` is not called. | VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| Ready-to-start is disabled when backend readiness is unavailable. | `canOpenReadyToStartChecklist` requires the visible `go_live_checklist` step and `per_step_validation.go_live_checklist.actionable === true`; `DemoStatusBanner` receives `isTransitionDisabled={isNextPending || !canOpenReadyToStartChecklist}`. | `SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx` and `DemoStatusBanner.test.tsx` assert disabled accessibility state and no navigation/callback when disabled. | VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| Pending/disabled banner actions expose accessible disabled state. | `DemoStatusBanner.tsx` sets `accessibilityState={{ disabled: ... }}` for Continue Setup and Ready to Start actions and shows pending indicators through the existing props. | `DemoStatusBanner.test.tsx` covers disabled Ready to Start behavior; SetupWizardFlow tests cover the wizard-disabled Ready-to-Start path. | VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| User-facing banner copy is localized and avoids legacy Demo or Go Live lifecycle terms. | `en-US.json` and `hi-IN.json` contain Progressive Experience status-banner keys including Continue Setup and Ready to Start. | `DemoStatusBanner.test.tsx` and `SetupWizardFlow.test.tsx` assert legacy `Demo` and `Go Live` wording is not exposed in the tested banner flow. | VERIFIED_COMPLETE |
| No backend files or Doctor Module files were modified for TG17. | TG17 implementation evidence is limited to onboarding presentation, tests, and localization files. The post-sync backend merge preserved platform and clinical exports without attributing Doctor Module work to Progressive Experience. | `git status` is clean in both PE worktrees after sync; focused frontend and backend verification passed before this reconciliation. | VERIFIED_COMPLETE |

#### Post-Sync Requirements Coverage Matrix

| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Remaining Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Req 1 - StepDetailScreen alias routing | COMPLETE | Shared alias routing evidence remains in completed groups 1, 2, and 5. | Re-audit only if backend templates change before release. |
| Req 2 - SetupWizardFlow alias routing | COMPLETE | SetupWizardFlow service-catalogue aliases continue to use the shared alias list. | None for current alias inventory. |
| Req 3 - Delete unused Treatments screen | COMPLETE | Dead onboarding Treatments screen remains absent from active imports. | None. |
| Req 4 - Backend template alias audit | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Current alias list is documented and tested. | Active-template audit remains release validation if backend templates change. |
| Req 5 - WizardDraftStore schema/persistence | COMPLETE | Task Groups 13 and 15 completed tenant/user-scoped draft persistence, migration, expiry, compression, and clean-state behavior. | Future Journey Versioning identity review only. |
| Req 6 - WizardDraftStore step-screen integration | COMPLETE | Task Group 14 integrated required wizard step screens; Task Group 15 covered lifecycle sync. | Release verification only. |
| Req 7 - OfflineBanner | COMPLETE | Task Group 16 added NetInfo-backed offline banner wiring. | Physical/emulated offline release run remains under Req 32. |
| Req 8 - Offline CTA gating and mutation flush | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Task Group 16 gates known-offline submit/complete CTAs; backend platform idempotency supports safe server replay after requests reach backend. | PendingMutationStore, retry/flush, and dead-letter behavior need queue/error/analytics design. |
| Req 9 - App lifecycle background/foreground | COMPLETE | Task Group 15 added AppState background sync, foreground hydrate, refetch, and changed-step notice. | No polling/conflict expansion authorized. |
| Req 10 - Android back button intercept | COMPLETE | Completed production-hardening groups preserve Android back handling. | None. |
| Req 11 - Tenant identity fix | STAGING_ONLY | Automated checks and fallback behavior are complete. | Provisional/live/multi-clinic staging confirmation required. |
| Req 12 - Idempotency keys | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Frontend idempotency keys and backend Platform Foundation idempotency tests passed in dev. | Same-key replay and tenant replay staging checks remain. |
| Req 13 - Demo/live transition hooks | COMPLETE | Task Group 17 wired DemoStatusBanner actions into SetupWizardFlow while preserving the checklist gate. | Subscription conversion, payment recovery, and direct transition remain explicit non-goals. |
| Req 14 - Theme compliance | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Touched Progressive Experience UI uses `useClinicTheme()` tokens. | Legacy untouched UI remains per-task cleanup only. |
| Req 15 - Test coverage | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Focused onboarding tests cover completed groups, including TG17. | Full frontend TypeScript/Jest baseline debt and E2E coverage remain. |
| Req 16 - Draft conflict modal | NOT_STARTED | No conflict modal is implemented. | Requires backend `updated_at` contract and conflict design. |
| Req 17 - Multi-device validation | NOT_STARTED | Foreground refetch exists, but no multi-device conflict flow is authorized. | Requires Req 29 and conflict-resolution policy. |
| Req 18 - Pending payment recovery | NOT_STARTED | Subscription/payment screens and APIs exist outside a recovery policy. | Needs subscription/payment ownership and UX decision. |
| Req 19 - Storage security audit | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Current draft fields were reviewed during Task Group 13. | Project-level storage classification and SecureStore decision remain. |
| Req 20 - Error message centralisation | NOT_STARTED | Existing generic error utilities are not an onboarding mapper. | Needs mapper boundary, localized key catalog, and tests. |
| Req 21 - Zero hardcoded design values | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Recent touched UI follows theme tokens. | Legacy untouched screens remain per-task cleanup. |
| Req 22 - Zustand architecture | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Wizard store follows synchronous Zustand actions plus standalone async helpers. | Future stores, especially PendingMutationStore, need design review. |
| Req 23 - Hook/service architecture | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Repository hooks and datasource boundaries exist for completed flows. | Legacy direct datasource calls remain outside current authorization. |
| Req 24 - Internationalisation coverage | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | TG17 added/verified English and Hindi user-facing banner terminology. | Future task strings need parity review. |
| Req 25 - Accessibility | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | TG16/TG17 touched notices and disabled CTAs expose accessible state/roles. | Broader legacy accessibility audit remains outside current task groups. |
| Req 26 - Duplicate submission locking | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Submit lock, stale submission guard, offline gating, and TG17 banner-disabled states exist. | Future commercial/payment recovery pending states need their own task. |
| Req 27 - Query invalidation | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Submit/complete invalidation, foreground refetch, and TG17 presentation-only routing exist. | Demo extend/transition mutation invalidation remains out of TG17 scope. |
| Req 28 - Analytics/audit events | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Draft storage failure/expiry logging path exists. | Structured analytics provider/stub and event catalog remain undecided. |
| Req 29 - Backend `updated_at` contract | OPEN_DECISION | Frontend DTO field exists. | Backend guarantee and staging proof are not established. |
| Req 30 - Tenant-scoped storage | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Wizard drafts are tenant/user scoped and cleaned on logout. | PendingMutationStore isolation not implemented. |
| Req 31 - Draft expiry | PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | Draft expiry constant and hydration discard exist. | Remote-config override and structured analytics remain undecided. |
| Req 32 - End-to-end release verification | STAGING_ONLY | Release checklist remains documented. | Runs A-D and tenant/replay sign-off require staging/device access. |

#### Next Implementation Decision

| Candidate Next Area | Requirement Support | Design/Ownership Support | Dependency Check | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pending mutation persistence / offline queue | Req 8, Req 30 | Partial only | Needs queue ownership, retry policy, dead-letter UX, error mapper, and analytics decision. | NO_IMPLEMENTATION_GROUP_READY |
| Draft conflict and multi-device handling | Req 16, Req 17, Req 29 | Partial only | Blocked by backend `updated_at` contract and conflict-resolution policy. | NO_IMPLEMENTATION_GROUP_READY |
| Pending payment recovery / commercial conversion | Req 18, Req 27 | Not enough | Needs subscription/payment ownership, endpoint scope, and commercial UX policy. | NO_IMPLEMENTATION_GROUP_READY |
| Centralized onboarding error messages | Req 20, Req 24 | Partial only | Needs mapper boundary, string catalog, and ownership confirmation. | NO_IMPLEMENTATION_GROUP_READY |
| Analytics / audit events | Req 28 | Not enough | Needs provider/stub decision and accepted event list. | NO_IMPLEMENTATION_GROUP_READY |
| Staging tenant and replay verification | Req 11, Req 12, Req 32 | Checklist ready | Environment/device dependent; not an implementation group. | STAGING_ONLY |

Selected result: `NO_IMPLEMENTATION_GROUP_READY`.

Dependency confirmation:

- Requirement support: the remaining gaps are traceable, but none has enough accepted design plus dependency readiness for implementation.
- Design support: no new frontend/backend task group should be created until the relevant queue, conflict, payment, error, or analytics boundary is clarified.
- Ownership: onboarding remains Codex-owned; Doctor Module, clinical readiness, workspace lifecycle, billing policy, and capability truth remain outside this implementation authorization.
- Frontend/backend impact: no code changes are authorized by this reconciliation.
- Staging dependencies: Req 11, Req 12, and Req 32 remain staging-only and must not be marked complete from local tests.
- Release dependencies: production promotion remains blocked by staging runs, baseline frontend TypeScript/Jest debt, and release sign-off.


## Task Group 18 — Journey Foundation and Card Presentation (COMPLETE)

Status: **COMPLETE** (2026-07-20)

TG18 implemented only the approved E1 foundation and reusable Journey Card
presentation slices. It introduced the versioned, tenant-scoped journey domain;
pure DTO-to-domain and domain-to-presentation projection; reuse of the existing
onboarding status repository/query, navigation, `StepCard`, `ProgressBar`, theme,
and localization framework; and safe presentation for supported, unsupported,
and recognized-empty journeys.

Completion evidence:

- the backend remained unchanged; no API, migration, repository, store, service,
  dependency, or draft-schema implementation was created;
- unsupported major versions fail closed with localized unavailable messaging,
  no partial cards, and no actionable wizard footer;
- recognized empty journeys present an explicit localized non-completion state;
- active journeys preserve authoritative card order and expose localized
  aggregate `completed / total` progress with progressbar semantics;
- tenant mismatch suppresses stale raw status and journey projection;
- English and Hindi keys have compatible interpolation placeholders;
- central theme tokens, existing icon/navigation systems, accessible roles and
  labels, and specialty-agnostic multi-clinic behavior are preserved;
- focused journey entity, projection, hook, Journey Card, progress, journey
  surface, and wizard integration verification passes (7 suites, 77 tests).

TG18 does not authorize TG19, Doctor Module, Clinical Workspace, scheduling,
inventory, billing/payment implementation, analytics-platform implementation,
backend redesign, or architecture rewrites. TG19 requires its own readiness
review before any implementation.

### TG18–TG22 Execution Ledger Reconciliation (2026-07-23)

This ledger records execution evidence only. Requirements and acceptance
criteria remain governed by `requirements.md`; bidirectional ownership and
current status are governed by `requirements-traceability-matrix.md`.

| TG | Implemented requirements and scope | Implementation summary | Verification summary | Status and acceptance reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TG18 | E1 constitutional scope; contributes to Req 5, 14, 15, 21, 23–25, 28 | Versioned tenant-scoped journey domain, projection, reusable Journey Cards, progress, empty/unsupported handling, and existing navigation/onboarding reuse. | 7 focused frontend suites / 77 tests; localization, Theme, accessibility, tenant mismatch, unsupported version, and empty journey verified. | **COMPLETE**. E1 constitutional documents and `TG18-IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md`; no numbered requirement is claimed complete solely by TG18. |
| TG19 | E2 constitutional scope; contributes to Req 11, 19, 24, 25, 30 | Clinic Entry/New Clinic/Bring Your Clinic, organization and tenant foundation, identity and verified-contact persistence, verification strategy, audit, idempotency, effective-tenant handoff, and frontend orchestration. | Final acceptance classified 27 Version 1 items verified and 1 out of scope; backend 154 focused tests plus prior 161 isolated-PostgreSQL tests, frontend 4 suites / 15 tests, Ruff, compileall, ESLint, and Alembic head verified. | **COMPLETE / ACCEPTED**. `TG19-FINAL-ACCEPTANCE.md` and the final acceptance entry below. Shared numbered requirements remain partial where their broader ACs extend beyond E2. |
| TG20 | E3 constitutional scope; completes Req 15 coverage for its owned surfaces and contributes to Req 11, 23–25, 27, 28 | Workspace Preparation domain, persistence/migration, query services, execution and retry boundaries, transport, frontend data/domain/presentation, and handoff. | TG20.1–TG20.3 focused domain, PostgreSQL, application, transport, frontend, regression, static-analysis, migration, and Supabase acceptance gates passed. | **COMPLETE / ACCEPTED**. `frontend/docs/TG20/acceptance.md` (final acceptance evidence) and `frontend/docs/TG20/tasks.md` (TG20.7 execution record). |
| TG21 | Req 33; shares regression ownership for Req 1–4, 15, 23–25 | Backend-authoritative capability/template projection, source authority, query/transport, frontend data/domain integration, and Journey presentation consumption. | Backend projection/query/transport suites and TG18/onboarding regressions; frontend datasource/repository/domain/presentation, JourneySurface, and SetupWizardFlow verification; fail-closed revision/tenant behavior verified. | **COMPLETE / ACCEPTED**. Req 33, the E4 design contract, and TG21 final verification and acceptance. Req 33 is complete. |
| TG22 | Req 34; contributes to Req 13, 15, 17, 23–28, 32 | Provider-owned readiness aggregation over TG21 setup and TG20 workspace evidence, read transport/authorization, frontend data/domain integration, checklist explanation, and bounded next actions. | Backend readiness/TG21/onboarding regressions (100 tests); frontend onboarding verification (33 suites / 235 tests) including isolated TG22 (5 suites / 45 tests); Ruff, compileall, ESLint, scoped TypeScript, localization, accessibility, and Alembic head `20260721_030000` verified. | **COMPLETE / ACCEPTED**. Req 34, the E5 design contract, and TG22.3 final acceptance. Req 34 is complete; commercial activation remains outside TG22. |

No prior ledger entry authorized a later Task Group. E6 is complete and
accepted. The approved E7 constitutional requirements/design and the E7
authorization record below now authorize TG24. TG25 remains reserved for final
E7 acceptance and does not authorize implementation detail beyond that gate.

### Standard Task Group Documentation Lifecycle v1.0

Every future Progressive Experience Task Group (TG23–TG31) must follow this
exact lifecycle without omission or reversal:

```text
Roadmap
↓
Requirements
↓
Design
↓
RTM
↓
Tasks
↓
Implementation
↓
Verification
↓
Acceptance
↓
RTM update
↓
Tasks update
```

Mandatory maintenance rules:

1. At constitutional approval, update `requirements.md`, `design.md`,
   `requirements-traceability-matrix.md`, and `tasks.md` together.
2. At implementation completion, update only the RTM fulfillment/evidence and
   this execution ledger unless approved product intent or architecture changed.
3. At acceptance completion, update the RTM verification fields and add the
   acceptance record here. Manual evidence must be identified explicitly; an
   absent manual run must never be inferred from automated tests.
4. No Task Group may begin implementation with missing roadmap, requirements,
   design, RTM, task boundary, or acceptance ownership.
5. Commits, tests, and acceptance results must be recorded from repository or
   accepted-report evidence. Unknown evidence is recorded as not identified,
   never guessed.

This ledger must not restate product rules or architecture. It records the
objective, authorized boundary, execution, verification, acceptance decision,
and stopping point for each Task Group.

### E6 Constitutional Requirements and Design — COMPLETE (2026-07-23)

- **Objective:** Freeze product and architectural ownership for draft conflict,
  backend step revision/timestamp authority, multi-device convergence,
  effective-tenant isolation, and safe recovery.
- **Requirements:** Requirements 9, 11, 16, 17, and 29–32 now reference the E6
  constitutional contract. Existing implementation statuses are unchanged.
- **Design:** Backend authoritative state/revision, frontend local-draft and
  recovery presentation, persistence separation, request-driven convergence,
  tenant switching, audit safety, accessibility/localization, and acceptance
  boundaries are approved.
- **Verification:** Canonical documents and current source ownership were
  inspected. Current backend progress persistence owns `updated_at`, the status
  projection does not yet expose per-step revision/timestamp evidence, and the
  frontend draft owns device-local `lastSavedAt`; no implementation claim is
  made.
- **Status at this checkpoint:** **CONSTITUTIONALLY COMPLETE / IMPLEMENTATION
  NOT YET AUTHORIZED**. The later readiness record and TG23 ledger below now
  supply that authorization; this historical checkpoint created no source task.
- **Acceptance reference:** E6 constitutional product contract in
  `requirements.md`, E6 constitutional design contract in `design.md`, and the
  affected E6 rows/readiness decision in the RTM.

## TG23 — Draft Conflict and Multi-Clinic Recovery (AUTHORIZED)

Status: **IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED; CHECKPOINTS NOT STARTED** (2026-07-23)

- **Objective:** Prevent stale device-local drafts from overwriting newer server
  state or crossing organization/effective-tenant boundaries, with deterministic
  accessible recovery and auditable outcomes.
- **Requirements:** Req 9, 11, 16, 17, and 29–32. Implementation fulfillment
  status remains unchanged until checkpoint and acceptance evidence exists.
- **Design:** E6 constitutional product contract in `requirements.md`; E6
  constitutional design contract in `design.md`; TG18 journey identity, TG19
  Effective Tenant/isolation, TG21 projection identity, and TG22 tenant/readiness
  boundaries remain authoritative.
- **Readiness:** `E6-IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md` — **COMPLETE / IMPLEMENTATION
  AUTHORIZED**.
- **Reuse:** Existing `org_setup_progress`, setup-progress repository, onboarding
  status/service/routes, active SQLAlchemy UoW, Effective Tenant/organization
  context, authorization, organization audit, Platform Idempotency, Wizard Draft
  store, onboarding datasource/repository/query keys, `useJourneyFoundation`,
  SetupWizardFlow, tenant cleanup, Theme, localization, and accessibility systems.
- **Out of scope:** E7 offline queue/replay, arbitrary or field-level merge,
  peer-to-peer draft sync, cross-tenant transfer, frontend-generated authority,
  duplicate stores/repositories/API clients, commercial lifecycle, Doctor Module,
  Clinical Workspace, scheduling, inventory, billing, and payment implementation.

### TG23.1 — Backend Per-Step Revision Foundation (NOT STARTED)

- Add the authorized additive progress-revision migration, model/port/adapter
  support, concurrency-safe revision primitives, active-UoW registration, and
  per-step status evidence including baseline visible steps.
- Verify migration compatibility, historical/new/absent rows, atomic revision+
  timestamp behavior, concurrent comparison, response compatibility, and tenant
  isolation with focused PostgreSQL tests, Ruff, compileall, and Alembic checks.
- Stop if the migration graph is not single-head/current or authoritative evidence
  cannot be produced atomically for every visible step.

### TG23.2 — Backend Conflict-Aware Submission and Transport (NOT STARTED)

- Compose expected revision, Effective Tenant/organization/permission checks,
  existing mutation, idempotency, safe organization audit, typed conflict, and
  rollback through the active UoW; routers remain rule-free.
- Verify accepted/stale/missing/cross-scope/concurrent revisions, replay/conflict,
  authorization, safe errors, audit, rollback, and TG19/TG21/TG22 regressions.
- Stop if a second mutation path or non-atomic commit boundary is required.

### TG23.3 — Frontend Revision and Conflict Data/Domain (NOT STARTED)

- Extend DTO/domain/datasource/repository owners, Wizard Draft schema v2,
  server-base/projection binding, typed errors, scoped cleanup, and pure recovery
  rules without adding another store/query/API client.
- Verify mapping, legacy draft migration, missing evidence, conflict eligibility,
  stale responses, expiry, isolation, and TG13–TG22 regressions.
- Stop if frontend must generate or reinterpret authoritative revision.

### TG23.4 — Frontend Conflict and Recovery Presentation (NOT STARTED)

- Add the domain-specific accessible DraftConflictModal and orchestration for Use
  Latest, Keep Local, unavailable refresh, completed/retired/hidden cleanup,
  duplicate-action protection, and tenant switching using central Theme and both
  locale catalogs.
- Verify no-conflict/conflict/repeat-conflict, Device A/B, tenant switch,
  logout/login, no leakage, focus/screen-reader/touch/font semantics, Hindi parity,
  Theme compliance, and presentation regressions.
- Stop before deleting a draft without a confirmed safe outcome or rendering any
  cross-scope state.

### TG23.5 — Final E6 Verification and Acceptance (NOT STARTED)

- Run the complete backend/frontend, PostgreSQL migration/concurrency, static,
  isolation, rollback, and Req 32 manual/staging E6 matrix.
- Fix only verified E6 defects; then update RTM implementation/verification evidence
  and this ledger acceptance record.
- E6 remains unaccepted while any stale-write, missing-evidence, multi-device,
  tenant-switch, accessibility/localization, audit, rollback, or migration gate is
  unverified.

Rollback order is frontend/E6-enforcement disable first, then backend compatibility
revert, then additive revision-column downgrade. No rollback may silently submit,
overwrite, or delete an unresolved editable draft. TG23.1 is the only authorized
source activity after this checkpoint; each later checkpoint requires a separate
execution prompt and must stop after its own evidence/commit/push.

## Notes

### TG21 E4 Constitutional Contract — APPROVED (2026-07-22)

The approved Phase 2 roadmap defines TG21 as **Capability-Driven Journey
Visibility**. Its product objective is to drive applicable journey steps and
Journey Cards from authoritative capability/template state while preserving
specialty extensibility, deterministic ordering, unknown-state safety, draft
recovery, tenant isolation, localization, accessibility, and central Theme
usage. The roadmap maps TG21 to Requirements 1–4, 15, and 23–25. Requirement 33
now supplies the accepted E4 capability-driven visibility contract.

TG21 is cross-repository. The backend owns tenant capability resolution,
template resolution, visibility authority, authorization, and tenant-scoped
response contracts. The frontend may only map that authoritative state through
the existing onboarding repository, journey domain, and Journey Card
presentation boundaries. Frontend-owned capability truth, hardcoded clinic-type
branches, new stores, duplicate API clients/repositories, TG22 readiness policy,
clinical workflows, scheduling, inventory, billing/payment implementation, and
Doctor Module work are prohibited.

Source-backed dependency and reuse findings:

| Area | Existing owner and evidence | TG21 finding |
|---|---|---|
| Journey foundation | `journey.entity.ts`, `build-journey-view-model.usecase.ts`, `useJourneyFoundation.ts`, and existing Journey Card surfaces | Reuse and extend; TG18 already owns journey identity, mapping, diagnostics, progress, and presentation. |
| Workspace preparation | Accepted TG20 domain, persistence, application, transport, and frontend handoff | Reuse only as the completed upstream dependency; TG21 must not change TG20 lifecycle truth. |
| Capability authority | Backend `CapabilityResolutionService`, capability catalog/tenant models, and `/tenants/{tenant_id}/capabilities` | Reuse as authoritative capability state. The response has per-capability state/version but no journey-step relationship or visibility snapshot version. |
| Template authority | Backend `OrgTemplate`, `TemplateRepository`, and `SQLAlchemyTemplateRepository` | Reuse as authoritative ordered setup-step source. Templates have a version, but setup steps contain no approved capability eligibility contract. |
| Current onboarding visibility | Backend `OnboardingService.get_onboarding_status` and the existing onboarding status transport | Current `visible_steps` is every resolved template step and `actionable_steps` is the same list. Capability state is not consumed. |
| Frontend capability access | `useCapabilities`, centralized tenant-scoped capability query keys, and `CapabilityGate` | Reuse where contract-compatible; presentation gating is not authority and cannot independently define journey visibility. |
| Draft behavior | Existing tenant/user-scoped Wizard Draft persistence and lifecycle handling | Reuse unchanged; the E4 contract prohibits frontend migration and assigns projection/progress transition to the backend using stable step identity. |

The following constitutional decisions are approved:

1. The Journey Template owns ordered steps and stable step identity; the
   Capability Registry owns capability definitions/lifecycle; only the Backend
   Journey Visibility Projection maps the two for a tenant.
2. Projection identity is `(template_version, capability_revision)`. Either
   value changing invalidates the identity and requires backend recalculation.
3. Unknown, unavailable, disabled, unsupported, or missing capability state
   fails closed by excluding its corresponding step. Frontend fallback is
   prohibited.
4. Active onboarding uses its current complete projection until the backend
   supplies a recalculated complete projection. Stable step identity preserves
   valid progress; removed steps retire; new steps enter incomplete; frontend
   migration logic is prohibited.
5. The backend owns calculation, ordering, DTOs, typed errors, revision checks,
   transactions, and rollback. The frontend renders the projection only.
6. TG21 acceptance requires deterministic projection, revision-change
   recalculation, fail-closed behavior, progress preservation, no frontend
   mapping logic, tenant isolation, and focused regression evidence.

With these decisions approved in `requirements.md` and `design.md`, the smallest
independently verifiable implementation checkpoint is the backend
domain/application projection that combines an ordered versioned template with
an authoritative tenant capability snapshot and produces a tenant-scoped,
versioned visible-step result with fail-closed diagnostics. It must be covered
by focused pure/application tests before transport or frontend integration.

There are eleven Phase 2 roadmap task groups remaining after TG20 (TG21–TG31).
This approval freezes constitutional behavior only. It adds no implementation
task, makes no source/test/API/schema change, does not mark TG21 in progress,
and does not authorize TG22.

### TG22 E5 Constitutional Contract — APPROVED (2026-07-22)

TG22 is **Ready-to-Start Checklist and Readiness Explanation**. Requirement 34
and the E5 design contract now freeze backend aggregate authority, domain-owned
providers, deterministic checklist/blocker/advisory semantics, bounded existing
next-action owners, request-driven refresh, readiness identity, typed errors,
tenant/RBAC security, localization/accessibility, acceptance, and rollback.

Source audit classification:

| Capability | Classification | Authorized treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Readiness provider interface | `MISSING` | Add narrow E5 port; preserve domain truth. |
| Readiness aggregate | `MISSING` | Add immutable tenant-scoped E5 domain/read model. |
| Checklist model | `EXTEND` | Replace local positional derivation with backend result; reuse UI primitives. |
| Blocker model | `EXTEND` | Adapt safe onboarding/TG20 evidence; expose no internals. |
| Next-action model | `EXTEND` | Bounded descriptors to audited existing owners only. |
| Ready-to-Start service | `MISSING` | Add read-only application composition; activation remains separate. |
| Backend endpoint | `MISSING` | Add Version 1 read transport after domain/application checkpoints. |
| Frontend domain model | `MISSING` | Add immutable mapping after transport. |
| Existing resolution routes | `REUSE` | Allowlist TG17 wizard navigation and domain-owned refresh/retry/support. |
| Tenant-scoped readiness query | `EXTEND` | Extend existing onboarding repository/query-key/cache boundaries. |
| Readiness permission | `REUSE` | Effective Tenant, active association/user, and `tenant.read`; no bypass. |

The following independently verifiable implementation groups are authorized in
this exact order. Each group must stop after its own focused verification and
must not begin the next group without a separate prompt.

#### TG22.1A — Backend Readiness and Provider Domain Contract

- **Objective:** Implement pure E5 states, identity, provider result, checklist
  item, blocker/advisory, bounded next-action, and typed domain errors.
- **Boundary:** Backend domain and pure tests only. No repository, database,
  application service, DI, transport, migration, or frontend.
- **Dependencies:** Requirement 34 and E5 design; existing TG20/TG21 value
  contracts inspected read-only.
- **Acceptance:** Unknown versions/states fail closed; ordering,
  deduplication/conflict, identity, provider-set completeness, and immutable
  safe shapes pass focused pure tests.
- **Stop:** Stop if a required value cannot be represented without redefining
  TG20/TG21 or adding a provider/product decision.

#### TG22.1B — Backend Readiness Application Composition

- **Objective:** Compose `journey_setup_progress` and
  `workspace_preparation` adapters through existing domain owners and produce
  one complete deterministic aggregate.
- **Boundary:** Backend application services/adapters and focused tests; reuse
  current UoW, TG21 query/projection, onboarding validation, and TG20 query.
  No transport, migration, new persistence, activation, or frontend.
- **Exact inputs:** Current TG21 projection identity/ordered visible steps;
  template `setupsteps[].optional`; existing setup status plus only `blocker`
  and `warning` validation results; TG20 read model/state; corrected evaluation
  context and identity helper. Both Version 1 providers are required/applicable.
- **Exact outputs:** The provider tables, item IDs/token families, state
  precedence, one workspace item, and four-action allowlist frozen in Req 34/E5.
  Provider exceptions return safe typed failures and never partial aggregates.
- **Acceptance:** Effective organization/tenant scope, provider completeness,
  required/optional/validation mappings, all five TG20 states plus missing/
  unsupported/stale/failure, precedence, stable ordering/deduplication,
  allowlisted actions, fail-closed partial/failure behavior, deterministic
  provider/evidence revisions, all aggregate states, and transaction-neutral
  reads pass. Tests reject unknown severity/error key, provider/action owner,
  arbitrary target, cross-scope/projection evidence, and raw leakage.
- **Stop:** Stop if an adapter would duplicate domain rules or needs a new
  persistence/worker boundary.

#### TG22.1C — Backend Readiness Transport and Authorization

- **Objective:** Add the read-only Version 1 endpoint, schemas, typed error
  mapping, and DI composition.
- **Boundary:** Existing FastAPI/onboarding patterns only; no mutation endpoint,
  migration, permission seed, or frontend.
- **Acceptance:** Active organization association, Effective Tenant, tenant
  user, `tenant.read`, Version 1 schema, leakage safety, and cross-tenant/
  cross-organization rejection pass focused transport tests.
- **Stop:** Stop if authorization needs an admin bypass or new permission.

#### TG22.2A — Frontend Readiness Data and Domain Integration

- **Objective:** Extend the existing onboarding datasource/repository/query
  architecture with typed DTO mapping, immutable E5 domain values, safe errors,
  scoped cache identity, stale rejection, and cleanup.
- **Boundary:** Frontend data/domain/hooks and focused tests only; no screen or
  navigation change and no client readiness calculation.
- **Acceptance:** Contract validation, all states, error mapping, organization+
  tenant cache isolation, logout/tenant-switch cleanup, and stale response
  rejection pass.
- **Stop:** Stop if mapping requires provider rules or client aggregation.

#### TG22.2B — Frontend Ready-to-Start Presentation

- **Objective:** Render the authoritative checklist/explanation and delegate
  only enabled bounded actions to existing audited owners.
- **Boundary:** Reuse `GoLiveScreen`, `SetupWizardFlow`, Journey/status/card,
  loading/error, Theme, localization, and navigation primitives. Do not activate
  trial/subscription/payment or add a general action engine.
- **Acceptance:** Empty, evaluating/loading, stale, unavailable, not-ready, and
  ready UX; blocker/advisory meaning; disabled/no-action behavior; tenant
  revalidation; duplicate navigation prevention; English/Hindi parity; and
  accessibility pass.
- **Stop:** Stop when an action lacks an existing owner/route.

#### TG22.3 — Final Verification and Acceptance

- **Objective:** Verify the complete E5 contract without new feature scope.
- **Boundary:** Fix only TG22-owned acceptance defects. No TG23 work.
- **Acceptance:** Backend/domain/application/transport, frontend data/domain/
  presentation, security/leakage, multi-clinic, localization/accessibility,
  TG18–TG21 regressions, diff/static checks, and rollback evidence pass. Confirm
  no migration and no commercial activation.
- **Stop:** TG22 is not accepted while any required provider, state, action
  owner, isolation, or fail-closed case is unverified.

TG22 authorization does not authorize TG23, a general Journey Action Execution
engine, background readiness processing, new persistence, trial/subscription/
payment activation, Doctor Module, Clinical Workspace, scheduling, inventory,
billing implementation, or architecture rewrites.

### TG19 Final Acceptance — NOT ACCEPTED (2026-07-21)

- Backend Platform Foundation, Clinic Entry, verification, audit, capability,
  idempotency, transaction, and PostgreSQL evidence: verified (159 tests).
- Clinic Entry choice presentation, English/Hindi parity, central Theme, and
  focused accessibility semantics: verified (8 tests).
- Required frontend Clinic Entry orchestration: not implemented.
- ADR-PF-017/018 runtime strategy resolution: implemented as resolvers but not
  consumed by an operational composition path.
- Controlling evidence: `TG19-FINAL-ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- Decision: `TG19_NOT_ACCEPTED`; TG20 remains unauthorized.

### TG19.1 Runtime Verification Composition — COMPLETE (2026-07-21)

- The configured contact and ownership strategy resolvers are consumed by the
  live existing verification transports through dependency injection.
- Manual request/review, authoritative evidence lifecycle, audit, idempotency,
  authorization, and transaction ownership remain reused and authoritative.
- Isolated PostgreSQL TG19/TG19.1 regression evidence: 161 tests passed; no
  migration or schema change and no new TG19-owned Alembic drift.
- TG19 remains not accepted solely pending the authorized frontend Clinic Entry
  orchestration checkpoint. Final acceptance was not rerun; TG20 is unauthorized.

### TG19 Final Re-Acceptance — NOT ACCEPTED (2026-07-21)

- TG19.1 runtime composition and frontend Clinic Entry orchestration commits are
  present and synchronized.
- Isolated PostgreSQL TG19/TG19.1 verification passed 161 tests; frontend
  Clinic Entry presentation verification passed 8 tests.
- Journey A remains blocked because organization creation is application-service
  only: there is no operational transport/frontend path for a zero-membership
  user to create the organization required by Clinic Entry authorization.
- ADR-PF-011 tenant-switch cancellation/cache/persisted-draft cleanup is not
  complete, and focused frontend tests mock rather than execute the orchestration
  hook.
- Controlling evidence: `TG19-FINAL-ACCEPTANCE.md`.
- Decision: `TG19_NOT_ACCEPTED`; TG20 remains unauthorized.

### TG19 Remaining Acceptance Blockers — COMPLETE (2026-07-21)

- The existing Supabase-authenticated organization service now has a bounded
  initial-organization transport that atomically creates the organization,
  owner membership, and organization audit record for a zero-membership user.
- Clinic Entry creates the initial organization before verification only when
  authoritative organization context is empty; existing-organization journeys
  continue to reuse their current organization membership.
- Focused tests execute the real Clinic Entry orchestration for automatic and
  manual-pending contact verification, ownership pending/approval, effective
  tenant selection, session refresh, retry without duplicate clinic mutation,
  lifecycle cleanup, and authoritative navigation.
- Tenant handoff cancels active queries, invalidates cached state, removes the
  outgoing tenant/user persisted wizard draft, resets in-memory operation and
  idempotency state, and then navigates after refreshed tenant validation.
- This checkpoint does not rerun final acceptance and does not authorize TG20.

### TG19 Final Acceptance — ACCEPTED (2026-07-21)

- All 28 Epic 2 Version 1 requirements are classified: 27
  `VERIFIED_COMPLETE`, 0 `PARTIAL`, 0 `BLOCKED`, 1 `OUT_OF_SCOPE`, and 0
  `STAGING_ONLY`.
- Journeys A through G are verified, including initial organization creation,
  existing-organization clinic creation, Bring Your Clinic, manual and automatic
  verification, tenant switching, and staff-onboarding isolation.
- Focused verification passed: backend 154 tests with 9 isolated-PostgreSQL URL
  skips, frontend 4 suites/15 tests, Ruff, compileall, and ESLint. Prior isolated
  PostgreSQL evidence remains 161 passing tests.
- Supabase PostgreSQL is current at the single Alembic head `20260721_020000`.
  The historical `org_staff` metadata target and repository-wide TypeScript/lint
  debt remain separately owned and are not TG19 blockers.
- `TG19-FINAL-ACCEPTANCE.md` is the controlling acceptance record.
- Decision: `TG19_ACCEPTED`. TG20 remains unimplemented; only its architecture
  and implementation planning may begin under separate authorization.

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for a faster MVP; all core implementation tasks are mandatory.
- Tasks 11.1 and 11.2 are verification/validation tasks — they require manual confirmation on staging and recording results. No automated test can substitute for the staging environment check.
- All UI changes must use `useClinicTheme()` exclusively — zero hardcoded colours, spacing, font sizes, or border radii (except `flex`, `zIndex`, `minHeight: 44`, `minWidth: 44`, animation timing).
- The `submissionId` guard (task 6.2) and the `Idempotency-Key` (task 11.2) are complementary layers: `submissionId` prevents frontend double-dispatch; `Idempotency-Key` prevents backend duplicate records if a network retry reaches the server.
- WizardDraftStore was excluded from the earlier production-hardening checkpoint. It is now complete through Task Groups 13-15. OfflineBanner visibility/gating is complete through Task Group 16. Other deferred items remain out of scope until a later canonical task group authorizes them: PendingMutationStore, Axios retry interceptor, conflict resolution modal, analytics beyond the approved draft-storage event path, i18n additions beyond user-visible strings introduced by an authorized task, accessibility enhancements beyond touched controls, and payment recovery.

## E7 Constitutional Completion and TG24 Authorization (2026-07-23)

E7 — Offline Mutation Recovery is constitutionally complete. Requirements 8,
12, 20, 22–24, 26, 28, 30, and 32 remain implementation-partial, but their E7
scope, ownership, invariants, prohibitions, retry/persistence/replay lifecycle,
security, telemetry, experience, compatibility, rollback, and acceptance
contracts are approved in `requirements.md` and `design.md`.

TG24 is authorized to implement only the Version 1
`onboarding.step.submit.v1` durable recovery contract. TG24 must reuse Effective
Tenant, E6 revision authority, Platform Idempotency, the existing onboarding
datasource/repository/query family, Wizard Draft scope conventions, central
Theme/localization/accessibility systems, and the approved application
telemetry boundary. It must not implement any prohibited operation family or
create a generic request queue, new backend API, migration, idempotency service,
tenant authority, repository family, or second replay engine.

### TG24.1 — E7 Domain and Safe Record Contract

- **Objective:** Implement immutable Version 1 operation, lifecycle, retry
  taxonomy, safe durable-record validation, payload allowlist, schema
  migration/corruption, expiry, and scope rules.
- **Ownership:** Frontend E7 domain plus the existing tenant/user-scoped local
  persistence boundary. Backend is reference-only.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Closed operation/field allowlists, prohibited-data
  rejection, lifecycle invariants, schema/legacy/corruption handling, expiry,
  user/organization/tenant isolation, and no source outside E7-owned frontend
  domain/persistence boundaries.

### TG24.2 — E7 Application Replay Coordination

- **Objective:** Implement the single replay authority for enqueue, claim,
  deterministic tenant FIFO, duplicate collapse, backoff, restart/reconnect/
  foreground triggers, cancellation, success removal, and terminal transition.
- **Ownership:** Frontend E7 application/presentation-hook orchestration using
  existing auth, Effective Tenant, connectivity, Journey Visibility, E6
  evidence, and query owners.
- **Acceptance boundary:** One active claim per tenant, original plus three
  bounded replays, fresh authority before execution, no competing transport
  retry, deterministic concurrent triggers, and safe tenant-switch/logout/
  authorization-loss behavior.

### TG24.3 — Existing Datasource and Repository Integration

- **Objective:** Execute only approved queued step submissions through the
  existing onboarding datasource/repository/query boundary with original
  idempotency identity and normalized typed outcomes.
- **Ownership:** Existing frontend onboarding datasource/repository and query
  keys; existing backend step mutation, authorization, transaction,
  idempotency, audit, and E6 conflict owners remain unchanged.
- **Acceptance boundary:** No new API or repository family; operation registry
  cannot build arbitrary requests; successful replay invalidates current
  queries; E6 conflict blocks and delegates without replacing revision;
  authorization, validation, malformed, unsupported, and idempotency outcomes
  follow the approved taxonomy.

### TG24.4 — Recovery Presentation, Telemetry, and Lifecycle Integration

- **Objective:** Integrate pending/replaying/conflict/manual/expired recovery
  states, bounded user actions, safe lifecycle telemetry, and existing
  wizard/connectivity behavior.
- **Ownership:** E7 presentation components/hooks, existing E6 recovery owner,
  onboarding telemetry port/provider or safe no-op adapter, both locale
  catalogs, and central Theme/accessibility primitives.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Refresh/edit/retry/discard/support actions appear
  only when owned; no silent deletion or infinite retry; English/Hindi parity,
  focus/live/busy/disabled/touch/font/back semantics, Theme-only presentation,
  and zero payload/raw-error telemetry leakage.

### TG24.5 — TG24 Verification and Implementation Completion

- **Objective:** Verify the complete implemented E7 contract and correct only
  TG24-owned defects before handing the frozen implementation to TG25.
- **Ownership:** Frontend E7 unit/integration/device verification plus read-only
  backend contract/regression verification.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Operation and data deny lists; persistence,
  migration, corruption, expiry; FIFO/locking/concurrency; retry/exhaustion;
  restart/reconnect/foreground; E6 conflict; idempotency; tenant/organization/
  user isolation; logout/switch; telemetry; localization/accessibility/Theme;
  rollback; and TG18–TG23 regressions pass with clean synchronized worktrees.

### TG25 — E7 Final Acceptance

TG25 is authorized solely as the final verification and acceptance gate after
TG24.5 completes. It may validate Requirement 32 staging/device evidence,
rollback, regressions, and the frozen TG24 implementation and may correct only
verified E7 defects under explicit execution authorization. It must not add E7
functionality, redefine contracts, or begin E8.

**TG24 IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED**

**TG25 FINAL ACCEPTANCE AUTHORIZED AFTER TG24.5**

### E8 Constitutional Governance and TG26 Authorization

Status: **CONSTITUTIONALLY COMPLETE; TG26 IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED**

`E8-CONSTITUTIONAL-DECISIONS.md`, the E8 requirements, design ownership, and RTM
are frozen. TG26 may implement only the approved commercial-trial lifecycle and
retention/recovery boundary. TG27 subscription/payment implementation remains
unauthorized.

Every checkpoint must preserve backend commercial authority, immutable trial
identity, server-UTC/configuration policy, organization/effective-tenant
isolation, clinical truth, existing customer terms, Clean Architecture, reuse
before create, localization, accessibility, Theme, typed failures, audit,
idempotency, concurrency, rollback, and E9 ownership.

### TG26.1 — Source Reuse and Compatibility Proof (COMPLETE)

- **Objective:** Prove the semantic fit of existing commercial, Demo, trial,
  subscription, readiness, export/archive, repository, audit, authorization,
  scheduling, and presentation assets; classify every legacy cohort.
- **Ownership:** Read-only backend/frontend source audit and E8 governance.
- **Repository:** Backend and frontend documentation/evidence only; no product
  behavior is authorized in this checkpoint.
- **Rollback boundary:** Documentation/evidence can be reverted without runtime
  or data effects.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Exact reuse/extend/do-not-reuse decisions, legacy
  disposition, allowed file boundaries, configuration ownership, migration
  count, test matrix, and stop conditions are source-backed with no unresolved
  implementation decision.

#### TG26.1 Completion Evidence

Status: **COMPLETE — 2026-07-29**

The proof inspected current backend and frontend source. The classifications
below govern TG26.2 onward and do not authorize TG26.3 or later work.

**Backend reuse classification**

| Capability | Classification | Source-backed disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Effective Tenant and organization context | Reuse unchanged | Existing authenticated organization context, effective-tenant selection, and membership authorities remain the mandatory scope boundary. |
| RBAC and authorization | Reuse with extension | Existing organization authorization remains authoritative; E8 adds only approved trial/commercial capabilities and must not create a parallel role model. |
| Active SQLAlchemy Unit of Work | Reuse with extension | Existing caller-owned commit/rollback and flush-only repository behavior remains authoritative; register only the E8 repository required by TG26.2. |
| SQLAlchemy repository pattern | Reuse with extension | Reuse aggregate mapping, optimistic-concurrency, database-time, tenant isolation, and history patterns; E8 requires its own repository port and adapter. |
| Organization/platform audit | Reuse with extension | Reuse append-only audit persistence and transaction participation; add only the approved E8 event vocabulary and safe metadata. |
| Typed-error pattern | Reuse with extension | Reuse fail-closed domain/application/transport mapping conventions; define only approved E8 failures. |
| Configuration framework | Reuse with extension | Existing typed settings remain configuration authority; E8 adds immutable trial and retention policy configuration captured at activation. |
| Organization idempotency | Reuse unchanged | Existing organization-scoped fingerprint, replay, conflict, and flush semantics govern E8 commands. |
| Ready-to-Start authority | Reuse unchanged | Existing E5 readiness composition remains the activation prerequisite; E8 must consume, not recalculate, readiness. |
| Existing organization/workspace lifecycle | Reuse unchanged | Existing organization, tenant, and workspace authorities remain independent; E8 observes their identifiers and does not replace their lifecycle. |
| Migration conventions and model registry | Reuse unchanged | Use the current additive Alembic/model-registry conventions and leave historical migrations untouched. |
| Scheduler/background-job infrastructure | New implementation required | No governed production scheduler/executor authority exists in current source. TG26.3 must not invent one without an approved Platform Foundation boundary. |
| API versioning and transport conventions | Reuse unchanged | Existing `/api/v1`, dependency-injection, schema, and typed-transport patterns govern later E8 transport work. |
| Legacy trial/Demo implementation | New implementation required | Legacy trial service, DTO, router, and `org_trial_sessions` semantics are compatibility inputs only, not E8 authority; they must not be extended into the E8 lifecycle. |

**Frontend reuse classification**

| Capability | Classification | Source-backed disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Onboarding repository and datasource layers | Reuse with extension | Add E8 operations through existing interfaces/adapters; do not create a competing commercial datasource stack. |
| React Query ownership | Reuse with extension | Reuse tenant/organization-scoped key, invalidation, foreground refresh, and cache-clear patterns; E8 requires distinct keys from legacy Demo. |
| Existing onboarding state and wizard flow | Reuse with extension | Reuse the current orchestration and handoff boundaries; backend E8 state remains authoritative. |
| Theme | Reuse unchanged | Central Theme, typography, color, and spacing tokens remain the only presentation authority. |
| Localization | Reuse unchanged | Existing localization framework and `en-US`/`hi-IN` parity rules remain authoritative; E8 adds keys only. |
| Accessibility | Reuse unchanged | Existing semantic, focus, live-region, loading, touch-target, and font-scaling patterns remain mandatory. |
| Navigation | Reuse with extension | Extend existing Expo Router and effective-tenant handoff patterns only for approved E8 surfaces/actions. |
| Generic status/loading/error presentation | Reuse with extension | Reuse existing primitives and presentation patterns while adding E8-specific semantics. |
| Legacy `DemoStatusBanner` and Demo hooks/models | New implementation required | Device-time countdowns and Demo semantics cannot represent backend-authoritative E8 commercial state; keep them compatibility-only and do not reuse them as E8 authority. |

**Compatibility and legacy proof**

- E8 is additive: it consumes Effective Tenant, E5 readiness, RBAC,
  idempotency, audit, active UoW, configuration, and migration conventions.
- E8 does not compete with E6 revision/conflict ownership or E7 offline queue
  ownership. Later E8 commands must continue to use those established
  boundaries where applicable.
- Existing seven-day/provisional and other historical trial records retain
  their original terms and authority. TG26.2 must not synthesize E8 identity,
  configuration, or lifecycle evidence for them.
- The legacy trial router/service and Demo presentation remain compatibility
  surfaces only. They must not activate, mutate, or calculate the E8 lifecycle.
- Subscription and payment authority remains E9. E8 may expose only the
  approved subscription-request handoff.

**TG26.2 implementation boundary**

- **Allowed backend areas:** E8-owned domain model/value objects/errors;
  repository port and SQLAlchemy adapter; E8 persistence models; active UoW
  registration; typed configuration extension; model registry; exactly one
  additive Alembic migration; and focused TG26.2 backend tests.
- **Prohibited areas:** all frontend source; legacy trial service/interface/
  router/billing schemas; tenant provisioning behavior; API routes and
  dependencies; scheduler/jobs; subscription/payment behavior; extension
  workflows; retention execution; and historical migrations.
- **Migration authorization:** exactly one additive TG26.2 migration for the
  approved E8 persistence authority and approved permission seed, with safe
  downgrade and no historical backfill or legacy-term reinterpretation.
- **Focused test matrix:** lifecycle/value-object invariants; unknown
  state/version fail-closed behavior; immutable identity/configuration;
  organization/effective-tenant isolation; create/load/history round trips;
  uniqueness and optimistic concurrency; server-UTC behavior; audit-safe
  persistence; legacy-row non-interference; migration upgrade/downgrade,
  current/head, fresh-database compatibility, and model-registry coverage.
- **Stop conditions:** stop if TG26.2 requires a second migration, legacy data
  inference, transport/application behavior, scheduler authority, E9 behavior,
  a parallel UoW/repository/configuration system, or any product/architecture
  decision not present in the frozen E8 constitution.

**Gap and readiness decision**

TG26.2 is **READY**: its domain, persistence, configuration, migration, reuse,
test, and stop boundaries are source-backed with no unresolved decision inside
that checkpoint. The governed production scheduler/executor required for
scheduled transitions is a genuine Platform Foundation gap for TG26.3; TG26.3
must remain blocked on that authority unless an approved reusable mechanism is
identified before implementation. This historical TG26.1 finding was resolved
on 2026-07-29 by
`ADR-PF-019-GOVERNED-LIFECYCLE-SCHEDULER.md`; it does not retroactively expand
TG26.1 or TG26.2.

### TG26.2 — Backend Trial Domain and Persistence (COMPLETE)

- **Objective:** Establish the approved immutable trial identity, lifecycle,
  configuration capture, history, retention schedule, compatibility, and
  persistence authority.
- **Ownership:** Backend E8 domain, persistence, active Unit of Work, migration,
  organization/effective-tenant isolation, and platform audit owners.
- **Repository:** Backend only.
- **Rollback boundary:** E8-owned additive persistence/configuration changes may
  roll back without altering historical migrations, existing paid/seven-day
  terms, clinical truth, or unrelated platform state.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Lifecycle invariants, UTC/configuration authority,
  uniqueness/versioning, legacy preservation, scheduled-transition evidence,
  audit safety, migration upgrade/downgrade, PostgreSQL, and isolation pass.

#### TG26.2 Completion Evidence

Status: **COMPLETE — 2026-07-29**

- Implemented the pure `commercial_trial_v1` aggregate with persisted
  `ELIGIBLE`, `ACTIVE`, and `EXPIRED` states; `EXPIRING` is derived at runtime
  and is absent from persistence.
- Added immutable organization-clinic trial identity, readiness evidence,
  audit correlation, captured duration/configuration, server-UTC timestamps,
  aggregate versioning, lifecycle validation, and typed failures.
- Added a flush-only repository port/adapter, active-UoW registration,
  organization/effective-tenant association validation, one-trial uniqueness,
  compare-and-swap activation, and append-only safe lifecycle history.
- Added exactly one additive migration (`20260729_010000`) for
  `org_commercial_trials`, `org_commercial_trial_events`, indexes,
  constraints, and the `trial.activate` permission catalogue entry. No legacy
  trial/Demo row was migrated, inferred, restarted, or converted.
- Verified 20 focused TG26.2 tests, 118 passing adjacent backend regressions
  with two environment-gated skips, 13 passing metadata/permission
  regressions, new-file Ruff, full `app` compileall, and an isolated
  PostgreSQL full-chain upgrade, TG26.2 downgrade, and re-upgrade to head.
- TG26.3 scheduler, application services, transport, retention, extension,
  subscription, payment, and all frontend work remain unimplemented and
  unauthorized by this completion record.

#### TG26.2 scope reconciliation

The accepted TG26.2 implementation is narrower than the full persistence
foundation canonical TG26.3 consumes. Source evidence confirms:

| Missing TG26.3 prerequisite | Required owner before TG26.3 |
| --- | --- |
| `SUSPENDED`, `ARCHIVED`, and terminal commercial `DELETED` lifecycle invariants and transitions | TG26.2A domain |
| Extension request/direct-grant/approval evidence and same-trial recovery to `ACTIVE` | TG26.2A domain and persistence |
| Retention-policy identity, UTC transition timestamps, and derived final-notice boundary | TG26.2A domain, configuration, and persistence |
| Immutable extension and retention lifecycle history | TG26.2A persistence and audit-evidence contract |
| Export-in-progress timeout evidence and legal/regulatory/statutory protection evidence | TG26.2A persistence and repository protection contract; external policy owners remain unchanged |
| Scoped compare-and-swap lifecycle update, due eligibility, protection check, execution claim/lease, and recovery operations | TG26.2A repository port/adapter |
| Due-work polling, scheduler registration/runtime, lifecycle execution, retries, orchestration, and typed outcomes | TG26.3 scheduler/executor and application |
| Activation, extension request/direct grant/approval, retained recovery, export/download handoff, and E9 request handoff APIs | TG26.3 application and transport |

TG26.2 remains complete for its delivered trial-phase boundary. The missing
retention and extension foundation is not silently reassigned to TG26.3.

### TG26.2A — Retention and Extension Domain/Persistence Foundation (COMPLETE)

Status: **COMPLETE — 2026-07-29**

- Implemented and verified the E8 retained-state, extension/recovery,
  protection-evidence, scoped CAS/due/claim repository, configuration, and
  PostgreSQL persistence foundation in backend commit `b5d7a60`.
- Migration `20260729_020000` passed fresh upgrade, safe downgrade, and
  re-upgrade against isolated PostgreSQL. Focused TG26.2/TG26.2A and metadata
  registry tests passed; no scheduler, executor, application service,
  transport, frontend, E9, billing, payment, or export implementation was
  introduced.

- **Objective:** Complete only the E8 domain and persistence contracts required
  for canonical TG26.3 to orchestrate retention, extension, recovery, and
  protected scheduled transitions without inventing aggregate or schema
  behavior.
- **Ownership:** Backend E8 domain, value objects, typed errors, persistence,
  repository port/adapter, active Unit of Work, typed configuration, migration,
  lifecycle/extension history, organization/effective-tenant isolation, and
  protection-evidence boundaries.
- **Repository:** Backend only.
- **Authorized domain:** Persist `SUSPENDED`, `ARCHIVED`, and terminal
  commercial `DELETED`; preserve derived `EXPIRING` and final notice as views;
  define legal server-UTC transitions; preserve immutable trial identity and
  original activation evidence; support same-trial extension recovery from
  `SUSPENDED` or `ARCHIVED` to `ACTIVE`; enforce the 30-day per-extension
  maximum and typed fail-closed invariants.
- **Authorized extension evidence:** Persist immutable request/direct-grant,
  approval or rejection, required business reason, approval channel, requester
  where applicable, Super Admin approver, decision timestamp, days granted,
  prior and resulting authoritative end timestamps, correlation, and
  idempotency evidence. No extension may create another trial or imply
  subscription/payment.
- **Authorized retention evidence:** Persist captured policy identity and
  durations, authoritative transition timestamps, append-only lifecycle
  history, export-in-progress reference/status/timeout evidence, and
  legal-hold/regulatory/statutory protection evidence sufficient to make
  deletion eligibility fail closed. TG26.2A does not own export formats, legal
  policy, secure deletion, or external protection decisions.
- **Authorized repository boundary:** Add flush-only scoped operations for
  compare-and-swap lifecycle persistence, due-transition eligibility,
  protection checks, deterministic execution identity, claim acquisition,
  lease renewal/reclamation/release, idempotent replay, extension evidence, and
  retained-state recovery. No polling or executor loop is authorized.
- **Configuration:** Add typed, validated Version 1 retention durations,
  extension maximum, protection timeout, and immutable policy-version
  configuration. Configuration affects future captured terms only.
- **Migration authorization:** Exactly one additive migration may extend the
  E8 tables and constraints and add only constitutionally required E8
  extension/protection persistence. Historical migrations remain untouched.
  Existing rows retain their current facts; no lifecycle timestamp, policy
  identity, extension decision, legal hold, export state, or protection
  evidence may be fabricated. Existing rows lacking required evidence fail
  closed for later scheduled retention until governed classification.
- **Audit boundary:** Persist append-only safe lifecycle and decision evidence
  suitable for later transactional organization/platform audit. No clinical
  content, export payload, legal document, contact, credential, token,
  fingerprint, payment data, or raw exception may be stored.
- **Rollback boundary:** Downgrade must preserve or refuse safely when retained
  states, extensions, protection evidence, or claims exist; it must never
  collapse retained state into `EXPIRED`, shorten terms, remove legal/export
  protection, restart a trial, or delete clinical truth.
- **Focused tests:** State/version fail-closed behavior; every legal and illegal
  trial/retention transition; derived-state behavior; immutable identity and
  activation evidence; extension limit and repeated extension history;
  retained recovery; organization/tenant isolation; optimistic concurrency;
  due eligibility; multi-worker claim/lease safety and expiry; idempotent
  replay; export/legal protection blocking; safe history; configuration
  capture; legacy-row fail-closed behavior; migration upgrade/downgrade,
  constraints/indexes, current/head, and model-registry coverage.
- **Explicitly prohibited:** Scheduler runtime, due-work polling, worker
  startup, lifecycle executor, application services, public APIs, frontend,
  E9/subscription, payment, billing, dunning, export generation/format,
  legal-retention policy, secure deletion, additional runtime registrations,
  legacy Demo conversion, or historical backfill/inference.
- **Stop conditions:** Stop if implementation needs more than one migration,
  a product lifecycle change, a second trial identity, fabricated legacy
  evidence, a scheduler/application/transport behavior, an external export or
  legal-policy decision, E9 behavior, or any weakening of tenant isolation,
  audit, idempotency, legal protection, or clinical truth.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Domain, repository, persistence, configuration,
  migration, PostgreSQL, concurrency, protection, rollback, and focused
  regression evidence pass with no runtime or transport implementation.

TG26.2A is complete. Its TG26.3 prerequisite is satisfied; TG26.4, TG26.5,
TG27, and E9 remain unauthorized until their existing prerequisites and
acceptance boundaries are satisfied.

### TG26.3 Prerequisite — Governed Scheduler/Executor Authority (COMPLETE)

Status: **COMPLETE — 2026-07-29**

- Audited the outbox worker and handler registry, workspace-preparation
  executor, active Unit of Work and audit/idempotency infrastructure,
  in-process async processor, FastAPI lifespan, legacy billing jobs,
  repair-on-read sweeps, and E7 replay/retry ownership.
- Confirmed that no existing component is approved unchanged as a production
  time-based lifecycle scheduler. The outbox worker and
  workspace-preparation executor provide reusable operational and execution
  patterns, but retain their existing event-delivery and onboarding ownership.
- Accepted `ADR-PF-019-GOVERNED-LIFECYCLE-SCHEDULER.md` as the additive
  Platform Foundation authority for explicit registration, database-UTC
  due-work discovery, bounded dispatch, claim safety, retries, system-actor
  audit, tenant isolation, and domain-owned lifecycle execution.
- Established the runtime authority later consumed by TG26.3: the minimum
  scheduler/executor contracts and separate-process runtime, the single E8
  registration/provider/executor, and canonical backend application/transport
  work. This authority does not make TG26.3 ready independently of TG26.2A.
- No scheduler, worker, lifecycle transition, API, migration, or frontend
  runtime behavior was implemented by this prerequisite.
- `ADR-PF-020-PLATFORM-BACKGROUND-RUNTIME-CATALOG.md` now governs runtime
  selection and ownership across the platform. It catalogs the Outbox Worker,
  Lifecycle Scheduler and Executors, E7 Replay Coordinator, Workspace
  Preparation Executor, FastAPI lifespan, `AsyncProcessor`, repair-on-read,
  and the non-governed Legacy Billing Job Service without implementing or
  expanding any runtime.

### TG26.3 — Backend Application, Scheduling, and Transport (AUTHORIZED)

Status: **COMPLETE — 2026-07-29**

- Implemented the single code-owned E8 lifecycle registration, governed
  scheduler contracts/coordinator, separate worker startup and graceful
  shutdown, typed bounded configuration, database-UTC due discovery, bounded
  concurrency, claim/lease execution, expired-lease recovery, retry exhaustion,
  deterministic execution identity, and safe worker health state.
- Implemented E8 lifecycle execution through the existing aggregate,
  commercial-trial repository, active Unit of Work, organization audit, and
  platform audit. Each execution validates organization/tenant scope and applies
  at most one legal transition; optimistic conflicts replay as safe no-ops.
- Implemented backend-authoritative commercial-trial reads, explicit
  readiness-gated activation, Organization Admin extension requests, Super
  Admin direct grants/request approvals and retained recovery, typed errors,
  Effective Tenant composition, organization-scoped idempotency, and
  export/download plus E9 subscription-request handoffs without implementing
  export generation or E9 behavior.
- Added the narrowly required additive platform-audit actor migration
  `20260729_030000`; it authorizes only the governed lifecycle system actor and
  refuses downgrade while its immutable audit evidence exists.
- Focused TG26.3 application/scheduler/transport tests and TG26.2/TG26.2A plus
  platform-audit regressions pass. Ruff, compileall, import composition,
  Alembic single-head graph, and diff checks pass. Applying the migration to the
  configured shared development database was intentionally not performed by
  this checkpoint; deployment migration verification remains an environment
  gate.

- **Objective:** Implement authorized reads and lifecycle commands, including
  explicit activation, extension request/approval, retained-state recovery,
  scheduled transitions, downloads/exports handoff, and E9 subscription-request
  handoff.
- **Ownership:** Backend E8 application/transport, E5 readiness authority,
  authorization/RBAC, idempotency, audit, scheduler/executor, and typed-error
  owners.
- **Repository:** Backend only.
- **Prerequisite:** TG26.2A is implemented, verified, accepted, and committed;
  backend synchronization remains the final Git gate before TG26.3 begins.
  TG26.3 consumes its retained states,
  extension/recovery evidence, transition/protection evidence, configuration,
  and repository/claim contracts; TG26.3 must not redesign or duplicate them.
- **Scheduler authority:** Implement against
  `ADR-PF-019-GOVERNED-LIFECYCLE-SCHEDULER.md`. Reuse the existing outbox
  worker's separate-process and concurrency patterns and the
  workspace-preparation executor's claim/transaction patterns without merging
  their ownership. Register only the E8 lifecycle job; business transitions
  remain E8-owned.
- **Final application/transport boundary:** Own activation reads/commands,
  extension request/direct-grant/approval orchestration, database-UTC due-work
  discovery, the single E8 scheduler registration/runtime, lifecycle
  execution, scheduled transitions, retained-state recovery orchestration,
  bounded retry and claims, idempotency, transactional audit, typed failures,
  and the approved export/download and E9 subscription-request handoffs. It
  does not own export generation/format, legal-retention policy, secure
  deletion, subscription, payment, billing, dunning, frontend, or another
  runtime registration.
- **Rollback boundary:** E8 routes, composition, and scheduled execution may be
  disabled while preserving records, elapsed commercial time, retained access,
  immutable evidence, and E9 boundary.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Actor hierarchy, `trial.activate`, readiness,
  explicit confirmation, concurrent replay, extensions, scheduled state
  transitions, export-in-progress protection, typed failures, transactions,
  retries, rollback, and tenant/organization isolation pass.

### TG26.4 — Frontend Data and Domain Integration (COMPLETE)

Status: **COMPLETE — 2026-07-29**

- Added the immutable Version 1 commercial-trial frontend domain contract,
  typed fail-closed failures, and exact backend DTOs without reusing legacy
  Demo semantics or deriving commercial policy on device.
- Extended the existing onboarding datasource and repository boundaries for
  backend-authoritative reads, activation, extension request/grant, retained
  downloads, and E9 subscription-request handoff. State-changing commands
  preserve caller-owned idempotency keys and disable transport mutation retry.
- Added organization/tenant/contract-scoped React Query keys, cancellation,
  bounded typed query retry, exact invalidation, outgoing-scope eviction, and
  aggregate-version protection against stale command responses.
- Focused datasource/repository tests pass with 28 tests. Scoped ESLint and
  `git diff --check` pass. Repository-wide TypeScript verification retains only
  pre-existing failures outside TG26.4-owned files.
- No presentation, localization, backend, migration, legacy Demo, E9
  subscription/payment, or TG26.5 work was introduced.

- **Objective:** Integrate backend-authoritative commercial and retention reads
  and commands through approved frontend data/domain boundaries.
- **Ownership:** Existing datasource, repository, domain/application, React
  Query, auth/effective-tenant, and canonical cache owners.
- **Repository:** Frontend only.
- **Rollback boundary:** E8 frontend data/domain integration may be removed
  without changing backend state, legacy terms, or existing readiness and
  subscription owners.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Typed mapping, unknown-version fail-closed behavior,
  tenant-scoped keys, invalidation, stale-response protection, logout/switch/
  authorization-loss isolation, transport retry ownership, and no frontend
  policy calculation pass.

### TG26.5 — Frontend Commercial and Retention Presentation — AUTHORIZED

**Status:** AUTHORIZED — Version 1 Product and Architecture contracts frozen.

**Version 1 authority:** `requirements.md` and the TG26.5 design contract now
freeze a single E8 retained-data destination with typed `DOWNLOADS`/`ARCHIVE`
modes; deferred non-navigating Support and pre-E9 subscription presentation;
mandatory trimmed `1..160` business-reason text; and the closed approval-channel
vocabulary `IN_APP_REQUEST`, `SUPPORT`, `SALES`, and `CUSTOMER_SUCCESS`.
TG26.5 must implement only those presentation/navigation contracts through the
existing TG26.4 repository/handoff boundary.

- **Objective:** Present eligible, active, expiring, expired, suspended,
  archived, final-notice, deleted, unavailable, and recovery experiences with
  only backend-authorized actions.
- **Ownership:** Frontend E8 presentation/orchestration/navigation, existing
  download/export navigation, localization, accessibility, and Theme owners.
- **Repository:** Frontend only.
- **Rollback boundary:** E8 surfaces/routes may return to the prior safe
  read-only compatibility experience without issuing transitions or hiding
  retained download rights.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Explicit Start Trial, extension request, subscription
  request, retained downloads, archive access, deletion timeline, loading/
  error/disabled states, English/Hindi parity, screen reader/focus/live/touch/
  font behavior, Theme-only styling, and no Demo semantics pass.

### TG26.6 — Final Verification and Acceptance

- **Objective:** Verify the complete frozen E8 contract and correct only
  verified TG26-owned defects.
- **Ownership:** Backend/frontend E8 verification plus release, security,
  localization, accessibility, migration, and multi-clinic acceptance.
- **Repository:** Backend and frontend; no new functionality or TG27 work.
- **Rollback boundary:** Exercise and confirm the approved feature-disable,
  persistence-preserving, schedule-safe, and frontend fallback boundaries.
- **Acceptance boundary:** Complete lifecycle, configuration, activation,
  extension, retention, recovery, legacy compatibility, export protection,
  E9 handoff boundary, authorization, audit, concurrency/idempotency, scheduled
  transitions, tenant/organization isolation, accessibility/localization/Theme,
  migrations, rollback, regressions, and Requirement 32 evidence pass.

TG26.1 is the first authorized checkpoint. No later checkpoint may begin until
its predecessor meets its acceptance boundary. A checkpoint MUST stop if source
evidence contradicts the approved contract or requires a new Product or
Architecture decision. TG26.5 is the next authorized implementation task.
TG26.6 and TG27 remain unauthorized until TG26.5 meets its acceptance boundary.

**TG26 IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED**

**TG27 IMPLEMENTATION NOT AUTHORIZED**

## Git Delivery Strategy

All future onboarding tasks in this plan must follow the Git Delivery Strategy recorded in `design.md`: start both repositories from latest `dev`, create paired frontend/backend onboarding feature branches, push those branches immediately, commit only reviewed onboarding files in logical groups, merge validated work into `test`, run integrated onboarding verification on `test`, then promote validated `test` to `dev`.

Multi-agent rule: one agent = one branch = one clean clone or worktree. Claude's Doctor Module work and Codex's Onboarding work must never share the same working folder. Unrelated Doctor Module files must not be staged, moved, committed, reset, or deleted.
