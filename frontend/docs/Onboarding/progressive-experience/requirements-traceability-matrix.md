# Progressive Experience Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Governance

This Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is the permanent current-state
implementation governance record for Progressive Experience. `requirements.md`
owns product intent and acceptance criteria, `design.md` and referenced
constitutional documents own design, the Phase 2 roadmap owns Epic destination,
and `tasks.md` owns execution history. This RTM connects those authorities; it
does not create product behavior or authorize a Task Group.

Status has exactly four values:

- `COMPLETE`: every acceptance criterion is supported by implementation and
  verification evidence;
- `PARTIALLY COMPLETE`: at least one criterion is evidenced and at least one
  remains open;
- `NOT STARTED`: no criterion has implementation evidence sufficient to claim
  delivery;
- `SUPERSEDED`: a later accepted contract replaces the original behavior and
  identifies its successor ownership.

Reconciled inventory after TG18–TG22: **11 COMPLETE, 19 PARTIALLY COMPLETE,
3 NOT STARTED, and 1 SUPERSEDED (34 total).** References such as “AC1–AC4” are
the acceptance-criteria numbers in `requirements.md`.

### Ownership and responsibilities

Product Architecture owns this RTM. Task Group owners supply source-backed
implementation and verification evidence; Product Architecture approves status
changes. The permanent authority chain is:

```text
requirements.md              product intent and acceptance criteria
↓
design.md                    implementation design and architecture
↓
requirements-traceability-matrix.md
                             implementation fulfillment and evidence
↓
tasks.md                     execution and acceptance history
```

None of these documents may duplicate or silently override another's
responsibility. The roadmap owns Epic destination and ordering above this
chain; it does not authorize implementation.

### Update policy and lifecycle

- **Constitutional approval:** update requirements, design, RTM ownership and
  planned status, and the task authorization record in the same checkpoint.
- **Implementation completion:** update RTM fulfillment, commit, and automated
  evidence plus the task execution record. Do not change requirements or design
  unless product or architecture was separately approved to change.
- **Acceptance completion:** update RTM acceptance/manual evidence and final
  status plus the task acceptance record.
- **Evidence rule:** record only accepted reports, repository commits, executed
  tests, and observed manual verification. Use `Not identified` or `Not run`
  when evidence is absent; never infer it.
- **Status rule:** a status change must cite the acceptance criteria affected
  and the evidence supporting the change. Supersession requires an accepted
  successor requirement/design owner.

Every TG23–TG31 lifecycle is mandatory and ordered:

```text
Roadmap → Requirements → Design → RTM → Tasks → Implementation
→ Verification → Acceptance → RTM update → Tasks update
```

No Task Group may skip, reverse, or collapse these authorities. The RTM must be
reviewed at every constitutional, implementation, and acceptance checkpoint.

“Not identified” means the reconciled canonical record does not name a commit;
it is not evidence of absence. “Not run” is an explicit open manual gate.

## Task Group → Requirements

| Task Group | Requirement ownership | Shared or remaining acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| TG18 — Journey Foundation and Cards | E1 constitutional requirements; contributes Req 5, 14, 15, 21, 23–25, 28 | E1 is accepted, but TG18 alone does not complete the cross-cutting numbered requirements except where prior TG13–TG17 evidence closes them. Future Theme, architecture, i18n, accessibility and analytics criteria remain with later Epics/TG31. |
| TG19 — Clinic Entry and Bring Your Clinic | E2 constitutional requirements; contributes Req 11, 19, 24, 25, 30 | E2 is accepted. Broader provisional auth deployment, security inventory, phase-wide i18n/accessibility and all draft/mutation isolation ACs remain open. |
| TG20 — Workspace Preparation | E3 constitutional requirements; contributes Req 11, 15, 23–25, 27, 28 | E3 is accepted. Req 15 historical test criteria are complete; other cross-cutting requirements retain future acceptance work. |
| TG21 — Capability Visibility | Completes Req 33; regression ownership for Req 1–4, 15, 23–25 | Req 33 is complete. Req 4 release audit and cross-cutting architecture/i18n/accessibility work continue. |
| TG22 — Ready-to-Start | Completes Req 34; contributes Req 13, 15, 17, 23–28, 32 | Req 34 is complete. Req 13 direct Demo/Live behavior is superseded, not incomplete TG22 work. Multi-device, commercial mutation, analytics and release-device ACs remain with later Epics. |

## Roadmap, Design, and Constitutional Validation

Every Requirement 1–34 has a roadmap destination and the matrix contains no
orphan requirement or orphan completed Task Group. E1–E6 now have accepted
constitutional design ownership. E1–E5 have completed implementation owners;
E6–E12 are not implementation-authorized:

- resolved decisions must be read from their accepted owners rather than
  reopened: E1 journey version/card semantics (TG18), E2 clinic entry/effective
  tenant (TG19), E3 preparation/retry (TG20), E4 capability/template projection
  (Req 33/TG21), E5 readiness providers/actions (Req 34/TG22), and E6
  revision/conflict/multi-clinic recovery (E6 constitutional contracts);
- E6 source-reuse/readiness and TG23 authorization are now satisfied by
  `E6-IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md` and the task ledger;
- E7 queue/retry/dead-letter/security and ownership contracts are resolved by
  the E7 constitutional requirements/design; TG24 is authorized and TG25 is
  reserved for final acceptance;
- E8 commercial-trial contracts are approved; TG26.2 implemented the
  trial-phase foundation, TG26.2A is authorized for the missing retention and
  extension domain/persistence foundation, and TG26.3 remains blocked until
  TG26.2A is complete; E9–E10 still lack accepted payment, recovery, and
  dunning contracts;
- E11 lacks dashboard/first-action and growth/branding authority;
- E12 retains Hindi review, analytics/security completion, staging/device
  access, and the release matrix.

### Minimum documentation prerequisites for future Epics

These are prerequisites, not completed constitutional work or Task Group
authorization.

| Epic | Minimum documentation prerequisite before implementation |
|---|---|
| E6 / TG23 | Satisfied by `E6-IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md`; TG23 is authorized and TG23.1 is the first source checkpoint. Implementation evidence remains absent until execution. |
| E7 / TG24–TG25 | Satisfied by the E7 constitutional requirements/design; TG24 is authorized in `tasks.md`, and TG25 remains the final acceptance owner. |
| E8 / TG26 | **CONSTITUTIONALLY COMPLETE; CORRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE; ACCEPTANCE CONDITIONS RESOLVED.** `E8-CONSTITUTIONAL-DECISIONS.md` v1.2, requirements, and design remain frozen. TG26.1–TG26.5, TG26.3A, and TG26.4A are complete. TG26.5A evidence is frontend commit `465365af2601ca32c2111de2f3a3bec4df25029a`; TG26.5B evidence is backend commit `a2ad7be` and frontend commit `0d1ca8cd`. Frontend commit `5fee1758` technically closes the repository-test handle and adds direct duration/channel, conflict-refetch, and activation-authorization assertions. The broader closure verification passed 154 backend and 98 frontend assertions, including a clean `--detectOpenHandles` run. Git and remote-branch evidence proves configured database revision `20260727_000001` belongs to the separate R7 migration lineage; E8 retains one valid repository head at `20260729_030000`. That mismatch is **Closed — Environment/Release Gate**: the Release/Database Migration owner must reconcile the integrated target graph and verify upgrade/current/heads after integration and before promotion. The other two Medium findings are **Closed — Technical**. No Critical, High, or open Medium finding remains; TG26.6 is authorized, while promotion remains conditional on the recorded database gate. |
| E9 / TG27 | Approve subscription/payment authority, provider boundary, verification and pending-payment states, security/idempotency, recovery, tenant isolation, tests, rollback, and acceptance. |
| E10 / TG28 | Approve dunning triggers, timing, severity, channels, non-destructive consequences, owned actions, localization/accessibility, audit, tests, rollback, and acceptance. |
| E11 / TG29–TG30 | Approve dashboard ownership and first-action source, capability/eligibility rules, growth lifecycle, branding/design-system criteria, analytics, tests, rollback, and acceptance. |
| E12 / TG31 | Freeze the phase-wide security, architecture, analytics, localization/Hindi review, accessibility, Theme, multi-clinic, staging/device, regression, release, rollback, and sign-off matrix. |

### E8 Corrective Checkpoint Evidence

| Checkpoint | Status | Evidence | Remaining boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| TG26.5A — Executable Commercial Retention Workflows | Implemented (Corrective) | Frontend commit `465365af2601ca32c2111de2f3a3bec4df25029a`; 29 focused workflow/localization tests and 109 broader onboarding regressions passed; scoped ESLint and `git diff --check` passed; no TG26.5A-owned TypeScript error. | None for TG26.5A. |
| TG26.5B — Remove Superseded Commercial Retention Downloads / Export-Package Architecture | Complete | Backend commit `a2ad7be` plus the companion frontend TG26.5B commit; 43 backend tests, 69 focused frontend tests, and 37 onboarding regressions passed; Ruff, compileall, scoped ESLint, and diff checks passed; no TG26.5B-owned TypeScript error; no migration. | None. Informational `REQUEST_WORKSPACE_DATA_EXPORT` remains intentionally unimplemented. |
| E8 Final Acceptance Re-run | Conditions Resolved; Conditionally Ready | No Critical or High findings. Closure evidence: frontend `5fee1758`; 154 backend E8/readiness/journey assertions; 98 frontend E8/onboarding assertions terminating cleanly with `--detectOpenHandles`; scoped ESLint, backend compileall, and diff checks passed. | Test-handle and direct behavioral-assertion findings are **Closed — Technical**. The R7-owned shared-development database lineage mismatch is **Closed — Environment/Release Gate**, with integrated-graph upgrade/current/heads verification owned by Release/Database Migration before promotion. TG26.6 is authorized. |

The roadmap's “open decisions” register is therefore historical in part: its
E1–E8 items are resolved by the accepted documents named above, while its
E9–E12 items remain genuine constitutional gaps. The roadmap itself is frozen
and was audited, not modified, by this reconciliation.

## TG23 Readiness

**E6 is constitutionally complete and TG23 implementation is AUTHORIZED.**
`E6-IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md` freezes source reuse, one additive migration,
compatibility, five bounded checkpoints, tests, rollback, and stop conditions.
TG23.1 — Backend Per-Step Revision Foundation is the exact first checkpoint.
Implementation fulfillment and evidence statuses remain unchanged until source
execution and acceptance are completed.
