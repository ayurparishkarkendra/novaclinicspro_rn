 * Phase 4 (R4) · T-E.3 — Treatment lifecycle parity verification (read-only
 * audit, no removal). Confirms TreatmentSheetDetailScreen.tsx (+ its
 * detail/ folder) is the single live Treatment lifecycle workspace: no
 * duplicate send-to-scheduling, treatment creation, or row-editing path is
 * currently reachable. Release/Review have no UI yet at all (T-E.5/T-E.6,
 * not built) -- "no duplicate" holds trivially for those two until then.
 *
 * This re-confirms (does not re-derive) T-A.2/T-A.3's own findings that
 * TreatmentPlansTab's create-modal and Send-to-Scheduling button are
 * dormant in the only reachable mode (admin) -- checked again here because
 * T-E.3 is explicitly the gate before any removal, and R4's own Group D/E
 * work since T-A.3 could in principle have changed this.
