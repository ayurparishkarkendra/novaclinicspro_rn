/**
 * R3B · T-0.5 — Characterization of the confirmed task-language and
 * multi-status violations (FR-D1/FR-D2), plus confirmation of the Phase 1
 * freshness baseline, BEFORE any Group B/C/D work begins. This is FR-D1/
 * FR-D2's own "before" oracle.
 *
 * MAJOR REALITY-CHECK CORRECTION (requirements.md §3.4/§3.5 and design.md
 * updated before this file was written): the ORIGINAL characterization
 * ("status badges render raw enum values directly — DRAFT, PENDING,
 * FULLY_SCHEDULED, PARTIALLY_SCHEDULED, SCHEDULED") does NOT hold. Every
 * status badge in the codebase (`TreatmentSheetStatusBadge`,
 * `getOrderStateLabel`, `getStatusLabel`, `getSchedulingStatusLabel`)
 * already renders a humanized label ("Draft," "Waiting for Scheduling,"
 * "Fully Scheduled") — the raw uppercase strings found by an earlier,
 * shallower grep are used only in comparison/filter logic, never rendered
 * as visible text. The conclusion ("a task-language violation exists") is
 * still correct — the CITATION was wrong. The real, confirmed violations
 * are two literal section/screen titles, exact matches to Doc 03 §19's own
 * negative examples:
 *   1. `app/doctor.tsx` — the doctor's own dashboard renders a section
 *      literally titled "Pending Documentation."
 *   2. `app/clinic-admin/treatment-sheets/orders.tsx` — the admin
 *      scheduling worklist's own screen header is literally "Treatment
 *      Orders."
 *
 * A SECOND finding (additive, expands FR-D2's confirmed scope rather than
 * correcting anything): `orders.tsx` — the SAME screen as finding #2 above
 * — renders a state "pill" and, conditionally, a separate scheduling-status
 * "pill" side-by-side on every list-item card. This is the same underlying
 * violation `TreatmentSheetInfoCard.tsx` already had, just as two adjacent
 * badges instead of one concatenated string — a second confirmed instance,
 * not previously characterized.
 *
 * UPDATE (T-D.1, resolution): `TreatmentSheetInfoCard.tsx`'s own
 * concatenation is fixed — it now renders exactly one primary status via the
 * new `getPrimaryOrderStatusLabel()`/`getPrimaryOrderStatusColor()`
 * (`treatmentOrders.dtos.ts`), which picks whichever of `state`/
 * `scheduling_status` is currently the more business-meaningful value,
 * never both. The `orders.tsx` instance (finding #2 above) is UNCHANGED —
 * that is T-D.2's own separate scope, not this task's.
 *
 * UPDATE (T-D.2, resolution): both task-language violations are fixed —
 * `app/doctor.tsx`'s section is now titled "Needs Documentation" (Doc 03
 * §19's own positive vocabulary, near-verbatim); `orders.tsx`'s header is
 * now "Treatment Plans" (reusing the app's own already-established
 * task-oriented term for this entity — `app/clinic-admin/index.tsx`'s
 * "Treatment Plan(s) to Schedule" widget already navigates to this exact
 * screen). `orders.tsx`'s own multi-status pill pair (finding #2 above) is
 * ALSO fixed in this same task (an explicit scope expansion beyond FR-D1
 * alone, approved directly — see `tasks.md`'s own T-D.2 note) using the
 * same `getPrimaryOrderStatusLabel`/`getPrimaryOrderStatusColor` T-D.1
 * built (and corrected) for `TreatmentSheetInfoCard.tsx`.
 *
 * UPDATE (Phase 4 · R4 · T-E.1, resolution): `getPrimaryOrderStatusLabel`/
 * `getPrimaryOrderStatusColor` no longer derive anything themselves — R3B's
 * own frontend re-derivation (including the "Needs Re-scheduling" drift
 * case) is superseded by the backend's single resolved
 * `lifecycle_status_label`/`lifecycle_status` (ADR-R4-02, T-C.2). Two
 * further, previously-undiscovered duplicate lifecycle-display sites were
 * found by this task's own audit and re-pointed the same way:
 * `TreatmentLifecycleActions.tsx`'s `OrderStateAction` (a state-derived
 * action-button label) and `app/doctor.tsx`'s "Needs Documentation" widget
 * pill (`getPendingDocumentationStatusLabel`, its own independent raw-state
 * branching). `TreatmentPlansTab.tsx`'s status chip was also re-pointed once
 * an order exists (its `sheet.status`-based fallback before any order
 * exists is a distinct, legitimate documentation-status display, not part
 * of this violation).
 *
 * FRESHNESS BASELINE (T-0.5's third responsibility): the existing
 * `isFreshnessV1Enabled` two-branch suite (`freshnessFeatureFlag.test.tsx`,
 * `consultationSaveFreshness.characterization.test.tsx`,
 * `freshnessNoDuplicateFetch.test.tsx`) was re-run in full before this task
 * concluded: 3 suites, 5 tests, all passing — recorded here as the
 * confirmed "before" checkpoint Execution Governance #8 requires. Not
 * re-characterized as new tests in this file, to avoid duplicating
 * already-passing coverage (same discipline applied throughout G0).
