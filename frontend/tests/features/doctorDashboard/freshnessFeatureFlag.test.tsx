/**
 * Phase 1 · T-A.6 (ADR-P1-01, FR-A6, RB-1) — consultation.tsx conditionally
 * restores the old key={episodeId:appointmentId} remount when the freshness
 * flag is OFF, and omits it when ON — verified via source inspection (same
 * established technique as T-0.5/T-0.7/T-E.1, since testing an actual React
 * `key` prop's presence through rendering doesn't reliably expose it).
 *
 * R3A · T-B.1/T-B.2/T-B.3: the flag-OFF invalidation-skipped tests this file
 * used to have (casesheet, prescription, treatment recommendation) all
 * moved to caseSheetModule.test.tsx / prescriptionModule.test.tsx /
 * treatmentRecommendationModule.test.tsx respectively — each module now
 * verifies its own flag-OFF behavior directly. This file keeps only the
 * source-inspection coverage, which isn't owned by any one module.
