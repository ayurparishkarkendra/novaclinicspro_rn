/**
 * R3B · T-0.4 — Characterization of the existing admin "Visit History" card
 * (`AppointmentDetailScreen.tsx`'s `VisitHistoryCard`), confirming it is
 * genuinely untouched by this phase's plan. This is BC-2's own oracle,
 * proving Group C's new Clinical Timeline did not silently modify this
 * screen. Mirrors T-0.1/T-0.2/T-0.3's source-inspection technique — this is
 * a structural/wiring characterization, not new runtime behavior.
 *
 * REALITY-CHECK FINDING (additive, not a correction — design.md §2.4 never
 * claimed the opposite, it just didn't go into this level of detail): the
 * card's OUTER container has no drill-down navigation (confirmed — "BUG FIX
 * #4" deliberately removed it, and the onPress prop it still receives is
 * never wired to anything interactive, so handleVisitHistoryPress is
 * defined but unreachable dead code). BUT each card contains TWO real,
 * interactive CTAs — "Add/View Case Sheet" and "Add/View Prescription" —
 * that DO navigate via router.push to the exact standalone routes
 * (.../casesheets/{new,[id]}, .../prescriptions/{new,[id]}) that T-B.2/
 * T-B.3/T-B.5/T-B.6 will flag-gate. This is a genuinely new, previously
 * unlisted entry point into Case Sheet/Prescription editing beyond
 * requirements.md §3.1/§3.3's own original audit — but since these CTAs
 * navigate to the SAME route paths Group B gates at the route level (not
 * per-caller), this is automatically and correctly handled by that work,
 * with no special-casing needed. Flagged here so T-B.2/T-B.3's own
 * "every current caller of the old routes is identified" (MIG-1) check
 * knows this screen is one of those callers.
