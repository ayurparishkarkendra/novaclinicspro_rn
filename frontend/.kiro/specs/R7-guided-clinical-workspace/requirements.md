# R7 — Clinical Operating System · Requirements

**Version:** 1.0 — **FROZEN** (2026-07-17) · **Date:** 2026-07-17
**Status:** ✅ **FROZEN AT v1.0.** Implementation specification authored **from the frozen architecture**. No architecture was reinterpreted.

> ## REQUIREMENTS FREEZE — v1.0
> These 42 requirements are **frozen** and are the authority for `design.md` and (later) `tasks.md`.
> **Design must implement these requirements — not reinterpret, extend, or narrow them.**
> Changing a frozen requirement requires returning to the requirements-approval process; it is **not** a design-time decision.
> The five **Engineering Truth Exceptions (§19)** and the marked **[VP]** verification points are the *only* sanctioned places where implementation resolves detail — and each names its owning group.
> **Downstream status:** `design.md` authored from this version · `tasks.md` **not authored** (awaits design completion + owner approval).
**Authority (constitutional, frozen — must not be reopened):** [R7-OWNER-RATIFICATION.md](R7-OWNER-RATIFICATION.md) · [R7-DESIGN-FREEZE-CHECKLIST.md](R7-DESIGN-FREEZE-CHECKLIST.md) · [R7-GUIDED-CLINICAL-WORKSPACE-DESIGN.md](R7-GUIDED-CLINICAL-WORKSPACE-DESIGN.md) · [R7-TREATMENT-SCHEDULING-MODEL.md](R7-TREATMENT-SCHEDULING-MODEL.md) · [R7-STATE-DEFINITIONS.md](R7-STATE-DEFINITIONS.md) · [R7-WIREFRAME-IMPACT-MATRIX.md](R7-WIREFRAME-IMPACT-MATRIX.md) · [R7-GUIDED-WORKSPACE-WIREFRAMES.md](R7-GUIDED-WORKSPACE-WIREFRAMES.md) · [R7-PATIENT-LIFECYCLE-GAP-MATRIX.md](R7-PATIENT-LIFECYCLE-GAP-MATRIX.md) · [R7-FEASIBILITY-AND-IMPACT.md](R7-FEASIBILITY-AND-IMPACT.md)
**Baselines verified:** backend `dev` `8b23568` · frontend `dev` `cd86021`. Every current-code claim below is verified; unverified items are marked **[VP]** (verification point) or raised as an **Engineering Truth Exception**.

**Principles every requirement obeys** (violation = defect, not a trade-off):
`P1` Backend Owns Clinical Truth · `P2` Backend Owns Workflow Intelligence · `P3` **DP-15 One Clinical Answer** · `P4` One Case Sheet per Episode · `P5` Append-only Visit Contributions · `P6` Living Document Supersession · `P7` Recommendation with Easy Deviation · `P8` Capability-driven workflow · `P9` Frontend presentation only.

**Owner decisions:** `D1`…`D9` + `F-1`, `F-2 = Option A`, Treatment Plan = entity, `Missed` decomposition, `PrescriptionStatus` deferred.

**Legend:** ✅ verified in code · **[VP]** verification point for implementation · **[R8]** deferred, integration point only.

## 0. Architecture Constraints (binding on every requirement)

| ID | Constraint | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **AC-1** | Backend: `Routers → Services → Repositories → ORM/DB/External`. No DB/ORM in routers; no business-data SQLAlchemy in services; no repository bypass. | `CLAUDE.md`, ED-ARCH-001 |
| **AC-2** | Frontend: `Presentation → Application → Domain Repo Interfaces → Infra Repos → Datasources/HTTP`. Presentation never touches `axiosClient`/datasources. | `CLAUDE.md`, ED-ARCH-001 |
| **AC-3** | Domain modules import nothing from `app.infrastructure` / `app.api` / a session — even transitively. | `capability_resolver` precedent |
| **AC-4** | Backend returns **semantics only** — state codes + localization keys. Never colours, icons, layout, or UI labels. | `D9`, R5/R6 precedent |
| **AC-5** | Every clinical question has **exactly one** backend answer; the frontend must be structurally incapable of producing a different one. | `P3` DP-15 |
| **AC-6** | All R7 behaviour is **flag-gated and reversible**; flag-off restores today's behaviour with no data effect. | R4–R6 precedent |
| **AC-7** | Workflow presence is gated by **capability**, never by clinic type/specialty. Specialty supplies **labels only**. | `P8`, `D8` |
| **AC-8** | Additive-only: no existing clinical table altered; no existing API contract broken. | R4–R6 posture |

---

## 1. Clinical Operating System (COS)

### FR-COS-1 — The COS is one workspace on the existing route
**Rationale.** Two workspaces already exist (`ConsultationWorkspaceScreen`, `EpisodeWorkspaceScreen` ✅). A third surface would recreate the duplication R7 exists to remove.
**Functional.** The COS renders on the **existing** `app/clinic-admin/episodes/[episodeId]/workspace.tsx` route ✅, behind flag `cos_v1`. It composes existing modules; it replaces none in R7.
**AC.** (1) No new workspace route is created. (2) Flag-off renders today's behaviour exactly. (3) All existing workspace tests stay green.
**Edge/Failure.** Invalid/absent context → explicit "cannot open workspace" state, never blank or wrong-record (wireframe W30).
**RBAC.** Route access unchanged; content role-composed (FR-RBAC-1).
**Backend.** none. **Frontend.** new shell composing existing components. **API.** none. **DB/Migration.** none. **Rollback.** flag off.
**Tests.** flag-on/off parity; existing suites green. **Depends.** FR-FLAG-1, ED-DEP-1. **Decisions.** D8. **Principles.** P9.

### FR-COS-2 — Frontend derives no clinical meaning
**Rationale.** Three live violations verified (ED-ARCH-004, ED-ARCH-006 A/B).
**Functional.** No R7 frontend code may derive workflow, recommendation, completion readiness, clinical summary, or interpret clinical content. It renders backend semantics.
**AC.** (1) Static check: no R7 FE module computes recommendation/assembly/completion. (2) Every clinical statement rendered traces to a backend field. (3) Absence is **never** rendered as a negative clinical finding.
**Failure.** Backend contract unavailable → explicit "unable to verify current clinical state"; **never** a locally-derived substitute.
**Backend.** owns all of it. **Frontend.** render only. **Rollback.** flag off.
**Tests.** architecture test asserting no FE derivation in R7 modules. **Depends.** FR-REC-1, FR-CR-1, ED-DEP-2/3. **Principles.** P1, P2, P3, P9.

---

## 2. Visit Command Center (VCC)

### FR-VCC-1 — The workspace opens on a briefing, not a form
**Rationale.** Design §4a. A clinician needs situational awareness before data entry.
**Functional.** Landing state answers: why today · what changed · before you act · recommended next · workflow pills · billing status. Forms open **from** the briefing (recommendation or pill), never as the landing state.
**AC.** (1) Landing renders no editable clinical form. (2) All six regions present or explicitly empty-stated. (3) One tap from briefing to the recommended task.
**Edge.** No purpose recorded → region shows "not recorded", never a guess. Long history → virtualized, filtered to the active episode.
**RBAC.** Regions role-composed; read-only roles see content, not mutations.
**Backend.** FR-CR-1 contract. **Frontend.** new `VisitCommandCenter`. **API.** workspace-state read. **DB.** none. **Rollback.** flag.
**Tests.** region rendering; empty states; role variants. **Depends.** FR-CR-1. **Decisions.** D7, D8. **Principles.** P1, P9.

### FR-VCC-2 — "Why today"
**Functional.** Renders appointment purpose + patient-stated concern from backend fields.
**AC.** (1) Purpose rendered when present. (2) Absent → "not recorded". (3) Never inferred from other data.
**[VP]** *Appointment "purpose" and "patient-stated concern" fields are **not yet verified to exist**.* → **ETX-3**.
**Backend.** must expose or model. **Frontend.** render. **Principles.** P1.

### FR-VCC-3 — "What changed" (R7 scope only)
**Rationale.** D8 limits R7 to currently available data.
**Functional.** Renders **only**: last visit date · latest visit summary · active treatment sessions · completed session count · pending review · current prescription existence/status · active episode · billing state.
**AC.** (1) Only the eight listed signals. (2) **No measurement deltas** (R8). (3) Each traces to a verified backend source. (4) Deltas computed **backend-side** (P2).
**[R8]** measurement trends — integration point only.
**Backend.** delta computation. **Frontend.** render. **Principles.** P1, P2.

### FR-VCC-4 — "Before you act" (R7 scope only)
**Rationale.** **F-2 = Option A.** Verified: allergies/interactions/renal **do not exist** in the backend.
**Functional.** Renders **only** verified-existing safety signals: pending clinical reviews ✅ · active prescription status ✅ · active episode ✅ · session progress ✅.
**AC.** (1) **No allergy, interaction, renal or hepatic panel is rendered in R7.** (2) No unbacked safety field is displayed — an empty safety field is prohibited (false clinical negative). (3) Absence of a panel is not presented as "no known findings".
**[R8]** allergy/intolerance/interaction/renal/hepatic/contraindication modelling — R8, backend-first.
**Rollback.** flag. **Tests.** assert no allergy/renal panel renders. **Depends.** ED-DEP-4 (ED-ARCH-003). **Decisions.** F-2. **Principles.** P1, P9.

---

## 3. Dynamic Workflow Assembly

### FR-WFA-1 — The backend assembles the workflow
**Rationale.** `D9`, `P2`. Verified violation: `buildSectionConfig()` assembles in the frontend (ED-ARCH-006/A).
**Functional.** A backend **`clinical_workflow_resolver`** (pure domain) assembles the applicable stages from: enabled capabilities · appointment purpose · episode state · existing clinical records · treatment state · clinician decisions · role permissions · billing state. A **`clinical_workflow_service`** (application) gathers facts and invokes it.
**AC.** (1) GP assembles `Consult → Visit Update → Rx (if needed) → Advice [R8] → Billing → Complete`. (2) Ayurveda/Physio assemble therapy stages **when the capability is entitled** — never by clinic name. (3) A follow-up with no changes assembles `Consult → Visit Update → Continue Plan → Billing → Complete`. (4) A therapist session assembles `Review Instructions → Deliver → Record Actuals → Complete`. (5) **No fixed canonical order exists anywhere.** (6) Steps absent when inapplicable — not rendered as permanent grey unless genuinely useful.
**Edge.** Capability revoked mid-episode → **[VP]** behaviour undefined; requirements-time decision (**ETX-4**).
**Failure.** Assembly unavailable → workspace shows explicit unavailable state; **no frontend fallback assembly**.
**Backend.** new resolver (pure) + service. **Frontend.** render only. **API.** workflow contract. **DB.** none. **Rollback.** flag.
**Tests.** resolver unit tests **without a DB** (per `treatment_lifecycle_resolver`/`capability_resolver` precedent ✅), one per assembly example; architecture test (resolver imports no infrastructure).
**Depends.** ED-DEP-3. **Decisions.** D9. **Principles.** P2, P3, P8.

### FR-WFA-2 — Permissions gate actionability, not presence
**Functional.** A stage the role may not act on renders as **waiting-on-role**, never hidden — otherwise a doctor cannot see the patient is blocked on admin.
**AC.** (1) Non-actionable stage visible with owner named. (2) Actionability derives from backend `blocking_factors`/`waiting_role`, **not** from `episodeWorkspaceConfigByRole` ✅ (which may hide a CTA but is never the authority).
**Principles.** P2, P3.

---

## 4. Case Sheet

### FR-CS-1 — One Case Sheet per Episode (find-or-create)
**Rationale.** `D1`/`P4`. `TenantCasesheetContribution` ✅ exists precisely for many-visits-one-sheet.
**Functional.** Opening the case sheet in a visit resolves **the Episode's** case sheet; creates one only if the Episode has none.
**AC.** (1) V1 creates. (2) V2 **reuses** the same sheet. (3) A second sheet is never created for the same Episode. (4) Standalone "new case sheet" entry points redirect to the Episode's sheet (FR-LEG-2).
**Edge.** Episode has a legacy null-`episode_id` sheet → **[VP]** data audit required before non-null migration (**ETX-2**).
**Backend.** service find-or-create. **DB.** none in R7. **Rollback.** flag.
**Tests.** dup-guard; multi-visit reuse. **Decisions.** D1. **Principles.** P4.

### FR-CS-2 — Contribution attributed to the **current** Visit
**Rationale.** **F-1.** Verified defect: attribution resolves the visit from `casesheet.appointment_id`, which is set once at creation and never reassigned ✅ → **every contribution after the first is attributed to the creating visit.**
**Functional.** Every Case Sheet write representing Visit-authored clinical content receives an **explicit, backend-validated current Visit context** (preferred input `visit_id`). `casesheet.appointment_id` **must never** be used to resolve current-visit attribution.
**AC.** (1) V1 create → V1 contribution. (2) V2 update → **V2** contribution. (3) V2 content never attributed to V1. (4) V3 appends without altering V1/V2 history. (5) Visit from another **Episode** rejected. (6) another **patient** rejected. (7) another **tenant** rejected. (8) Unresolved Visit → **explicit failure**. (11) Existing historical contributions unchanged. (12) `appointment_id` treated only as creation provenance.
**Transport.** route param / request field / server-resolved workspace context — **[VP]**, follow existing API conventions. The **business rule is frozen**.
**Backend.** service correction. **Frontend.** must supply/permit the current visit context. **API.** additive input. **DB.** none. **Rollback.** revert service (additive behaviour).
**Tests.** N-visit attribution; each rejection case. **Depends.** FR-CS-3. **Decisions.** D1/F-1. **Principles.** P4, P5.

### FR-CS-3 — Atomic content + contribution
**Rationale.** F-1. Verified: the code documents that when no visit resolves, *"no contribution row is inserted; the content update still succeeds (additive, not an error)"* ✅ — prohibited under `P4`/`P5`.
**Functional.** Content update **and** contribution recording succeed together or fail together.
**AC.** (9) No content update succeeds while its required contribution is missing. (8) Unresolved Visit → explicit failure, nothing persisted.
**✅ Positive Engineering Truth finding:** the mechanism **already exists** — `SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork` exposes `commit()`/`rollback()` and holds **both** `casesheet_contribution_repo` and `visit_repo` on the same session ✅, and the contribution create already runs **inside** the same transaction as the content update, before `uow.commit()` ✅. **The fix is removing the permissive `if visit:` guard, not building transactionality.** Sizing: **Small**, not Medium.
**Backend.** service. **DB.** none. **Rollback.** revert service.
**Tests.** failure injection → neither persists. **Decisions.** F-1. **Principles.** P5.

### FR-CS-4 — Idempotent contribution
**Functional.** Retries must not create duplicate contributions.
**AC.** (10) A retry yields exactly one contribution.
**[VP]** **Key deliberately not invented** (owner-directed): Engineering Truth determines whether it is Case Sheet + Visit + authoring operation · an explicit contribution id · a mutation/request id · another established mechanism. **Implementation must decide and test it.**
**Tests.** duplicate-submit; retry-after-timeout. **Decisions.** F-1.

### FR-CS-5 — Append-only visit notes surface
**Rationale.** The contribution model exists ✅ but **has no UI**.
**Functional.** Prior visits' notes are visibly retained with author + timestamp; a visit appends, never overwrites.
**AC.** (1) Prior notes never overwritten. (2) Author/timestamp shown per contribution. (3) Ordering by `contributed_at` ✅.
**Frontend.** new surface. **Principles.** P5.

### FR-CS-6 — Audit
**Functional.** Every contribution records actor, time, and the visit. Amendments additionally record reason (FR-LD-2).
**AC.** Attribution is reconstructible per visit for the life of the Episode.

---

## 5. Living Documents (Supersession)

### FR-LD-1 — Signed versions are immutable; documents remain amendable
**Rationale.** `D2`/`P6`. Resolves the verified contradiction: `DocumentStatus` docstring says *"FINAL: Locked… SIGNED: Immutable, terminal"* ✅ vs "completion must never imply permanent locking".
**Functional.** `DRAFT → FINAL → SIGNED → SUPERSEDED`. An amendment creates a **new version** referencing and **retaining** the prior, recording author/reason/timestamp, following the normal draft/final/sign lifecycle. Applies to Case Sheet, Prescription, Treatment Plan (and Treatment Sheet where clinically/legally appropriate).
**AC.** (1) No path mutates a `SIGNED` version. (2) A superseded version remains renderable/printable **exactly as signed**, visibly marked superseded. (3) Never deleted by ordinary editing. (4) Prints identify the version and whether an amendment exists.
**Backend.** version/supersession representation → **schema change**, **[VP]** representation deferred to implementation. **Rollback.** ⚠ data-shaped — flags roll back code, not records; rollback plan required.
**Tests.** immutability of signed version; supersession chain; print identification.
**Depends.** FR-LD-3. **Decisions.** D2. **Principles.** P6.

### FR-LD-2 — Amendment permissions
**Functional.** Amendment requires an explicit permission distinct from write. Doctors amend; admins/therapists do not.
**[VP]** exact permission codes unverified → **ETX-1**.
**AC.** Unpermitted amend attempt rejected at the **service** layer (not merely hidden in UI).
**Principles.** P1.

### FR-LD-3 — Close the docstring contradiction
**Functional.** `DocumentStatus`'s documented meaning is updated to match the ratified supersession model.
**AC.** Docstring and ratification agree. **Backend.** docs only. **Decisions.** D2.

---

## 6. Prescription

### FR-RX-1 — Verified document lifecycle only
**Rationale.** `D3`. Verified: `tenant_prescription.status` = `document_status` ENUM `DRAFT/FINAL/SIGNED` ✅; `PrescriptionStatus(draft/issued/dispensed)` has **zero runtime usages** ✅.
**Functional.** R7 implements **only** `DRAFT → FINAL → SIGNED` (+`SUPERSEDED` per FR-LD-1). Signing is the point the prescription becomes dispensable.
**AC.** (1) **No `Issue` or `Dispense` action exists** anywhere in R7. (2) Signing records `signed_by_staff_id`/`signed_at` ✅. (3) Editing is `DRAFT`-only; `FINAL`/`SIGNED` change only by amendment.
**[R8]** dispensing fulfilment (`NOT_STARTED → PARTIALLY_DISPENSED → DISPENSED`) — **separate domain object and lifecycle**, integration point only.
**Depends.** ED-DEP-5 (ED-ARCH-002). **Decisions.** D3. **Principles.** P1.

### FR-RX-2 — Copy-forward is **not** in R7
**Rationale.** `D5` → R8; its reconciliation gate cannot check anything today (F-2).
**AC.** No copy-forward action ships in R7. **[R8]** full capability + mandatory reconciliation, gated on allergy/medication modelling.

---

## 7. Treatment Recommendation

### FR-TR-1 — Recommendation is a proposal, not a course design
**Functional.** Answers *"should this patient receive a course?"* May carry recommended categories, clinical reason, high-level duration suggestion, priority, preliminary precautions, notes. It does **not** own the final course design.
**AC.** (1) A recommendation may lead to **one** approved Treatment Plan. (2) It contains no committed dates. (3) Handoff to admin is visible to the doctor as waiting-on-role (FR-WFA-2).
**Backend.** existing routers reused ✅. **Decisions.** D8. **Principles.** P8.

---

## 8. Treatment Plan

### FR-TP-1 — Treatment Plan is a first-class persisted, versioned entity
**Rationale.** Ratified. **Verified: no Plan entity exists** — `app/domain/treatment_plan/` holds only a `SyncResult` ✅; "treatment plan" is today a free-text **`TEXT` column on `tenant_visits`** ✅.
**Functional.** The Plan answers *"what course is clinically intended?"* and owns: patient · Episode · originating Recommendation · authoring clinician · therapies · approximate/authorized session count · frequency · scheduling intent · preferred interval · sequencing pattern · review milestones · completion criteria · course-level precautions · clinically relevant therapist requirements · status · document version · supersession relationship · provenance. **It contains no committed dates.**
**AC.** (1) Recommendation → one approved Plan. (2) Plan persists **independently** of scheduling. (3) Rescheduling does not change the Plan. (13) **Schedule-only changes create no new Plan version.** (14) Workflow intelligence derives treatment readiness from the authoritative Plan + Sessions. (15) The frontend **never** reconstructs the Plan from schedule rows.
**Rejected (recorded).** Plan-as-projection — would let schedule churn alter clinical intent; breaks review-dependent continuation, versioning, authorship, completion criteria; violates DP-15.
**Backend.** **new entity + repository + service.** **DB.** ⚠ **new table** — **R7's first additive migration.** **Migration.** additive; rollback = drop the new table (no data loss; nothing existing altered). **Frontend.** render only.
**Tests.** persistence independent of schedule; reschedule leaves Plan untouched.
**Depends.** FR-TP-2. **Decisions.** Treatment Plan resolution. **Principles.** P1, P3, P6.

### FR-TP-2 — Plan lifecycle: semantic stages frozen, spelling deferred
**Functional.** Stages: Authoring · Approved clinical intent · Available for scheduling · Active course · Under clinical review · Completed · Superseded/amended · Stopped/discontinued.
**AC.** (1) Every stage is representable. (2) The model is the **smallest additive** one that expresses them.
**[VP]** **Exact enum spelling deferred** (owner-directed). ⚠ **Do not reuse the R4 `TreatmentLifecycleStatus` 11 statuses without verifying semantic fit** — verified: those are *treatment execution* statuses ("for a given treatment at a given time") ✅, **not Plan lifecycle**. Overlap is partial, not identity. Overloading one enum with two concerns is what produced ED-ARCH-002.
**Decisions.** Treatment Plan resolution.

### FR-TP-3 — Plan amendment vs schedule change
**Functional.** Four **distinct** operations, never conflated: (a) change clinical intent → **new Plan version**; (b) change schedule logistics → **no** new Plan version; (c) edit an unexecuted session's instructions → session-level, no Plan version; (d) correct an execution record → audit-controlled correction.
**AC.** (12) Clinical amendments versioned/superseded. (13) Schedule-only changes create no Plan version. Amendment preserves already-executed sessions and defines the effect on future unexecuted sessions.
**Principles.** P6.

---

## 9. Treatment Sessions

### FR-TS-1 — Stable session identity
**Rationale.** Ratified. Verified: `treatment_sheet_row` already has `session_id`, `session_date`, `assigned_staff_id`, `status`, `completed_at`, `completed_by_staff_id` ✅ **plus legacy `day_number`** ✅ — the separation is ~70% done.
**Functional.** A Session's identity is stable and **never recreated** during rescheduling · therapist/room reassignment · time/date change · temporary hold · instruction update. **`day_number` is not durable identity**; it may remain as a legacy ordinal for display/migration only.
**AC.** (4) Sessions link to the Plan. (5) Identity survives date/time/therapist/room change. (10) Sessions added without recreating existing ones. (11) Reducing the course deletes no historical/executed Sessions.
**Prohibited.** "Schedule regeneration" as a concept — the only operations are create · update attributes · cancel/miss · add.
**Decisions.** Treatment Plan resolution. **Principles.** P1.

### FR-TS-2 — Schedule attributes
**Functional.** Operational scheduling owns date · start/end time · therapist · room · bed · resource allocation · operational status. These change **without** changing Plan identity, Session identity, doctor content, or execution history.
**AC.** (3)/(6): reschedule changes no Plan and loses no instructions.

### FR-TS-3 — Doctor clinical content bound to session identity
**Functional.** After a Session has identity and scheduling context, an authorized doctor authors: therapies · medicines · oils · materials · intended duration · precautions · special instructions · preparation instructions · expected outcome · clinical notes. Content attaches to **Session identity**.
**AC.** (6) **Doctor instructions survive rescheduling** — by construction, not by careful coding. Rescheduling never deletes, regenerates, detaches or silently remaps content.
**Adoption requirement.** **Author-once-apply-to-many** across selected sessions with per-session override — without it a 14-session course is unusable (correctness fine, adoption not).
**Principles.** P1.

### FR-TS-4 — Therapist execution record
**Functional.** Records actual start/end · actual duration · therapies delivered · medicines/materials used · deviations · patient response · observations · adverse events **[VP]** · completion outcome · therapist identity · timestamps.
**AC.** (7) Actuals remain attached to the executed Session. Execution history is **append-only or version/audit controlled**; a reschedule **never** overwrites an execution record.
**Principles.** P1, P6.

### FR-TS-5 — "Missed" is decomposed, not a single state
**Rationale.** Ratified.
**Functional.** Backend semantics distinguish **what was scheduled** · **whether execution occurred** · **why it did not** (structured reason). The UI may render *"Missed — Patient no-show"*.
**AC.** (1) No single ambiguous `MISSED` state is the sole source of truth. (2) The rendered label is composed from the three backend facts.
**[VP]** exact state names → implementation, after Engineering Truth.

---

## 10. Scheduling

### FR-SCH-1 — Scheduling intents
**Functional.** The Plan expresses: consecutive · alternate-day · specific weekdays · weekly · multiple/week · non-sequential · **PRN** · **review-dependent continuation** · planned review after a session milestone. Scheduling converts intent into real sessions.
**AC.** (8) Consecutive **and** non-sequential courses supported. (9) Review-dependent continuation supported. **PRN** pre-creates **no** dates; sessions are created on demand. Review-dependent schedules only to the review milestone.
**Rationale.** These are exactly what a fixed "Day 1..Day N" sheet cannot express.
**Principles.** P8 (capability-gated: Ayurveda · Physiotherapy · Dental · Orthopedics · Rehabilitation · Pain Management · future — **never specialty-gated**).

### FR-SCH-2 — Synchronization semantics
**Functional.** Reschedule → date attribute only · therapist change → assignment only · room change → attribute only · cancellation → status + reason, **content retained** · missed → FR-TS-5 · additional session → new identity appended · reduced course → future sessions cancelled, past untouched.
**AC.** Every event above preserves doctor content and execution history.
**Concurrency.** Doctor authoring while admin reschedules must not silently clobber → conflict surfaces reload/keep (OCC precedent: R5 `version`/If-Match ✅, `document_version` ✅).

---

## 11. Billing Visibility

### FR-BILL-1 — Billing is visible, doctor read-only
**Rationale.** `D6`. Verified spine: `TenantClinicalService.visit_id` is **`nullable=False`** ✅ → `TenantInvoiceLine.clinical_service_id` ✅ → invoice → payment.
**Functional.** The workspace shows consultation charges · clinical services · therapy/session charges · medicines · consumables · procedures · invoice status · payment status · outstanding balance. Doctors: **read-only**. Admin/front desk: charges, invoices, discounts, taxes, payments, balances, write-offs where permitted.
**AC.** (1) Doctor sees billing, cannot mutate. (2) Capability-gated — clinics without billing see no stage.
**Backend.** additive read contract reusing the existing spine. **DB.** none.
**Decisions.** D6. **Principles.** P8.

### FR-BILL-2 — Clinical completion ≠ financial completion
**Functional.** Unbilled services produce a **visible warning**; the doctor may clinically complete the visit; operational closure may remain pending. **Billing never blocks clinical work by default.**
**AC.** (1) Completion with unbilled services succeeds, with a warning. (2) **No hard block is hard-coded.** (3) Any tenant policy that blocks operational closure is **explicitly configured** — **[VP]**, not built in R7.
**Decisions.** D6.

---

## 12. Workflow Recommendations

### FR-REC-1 — The backend owns the recommendation
**Rationale.** `D9`/`P2`.
**Functional.** The `clinical_workflow_service` returns: `recommended_action` · `reason` · `blocking_factors` · `waiting_role` · `completion_readiness` (+ alternatives; confidence **[R8]**). The frontend renders it.
**AC.** (1) The contract returns **no** presentation fields (colours/icons/layout/UI labels) — contract test. (2) State codes + localization keys only. (3) **The frontend computes no recommendation.**
**Backend.** service + pure resolver. **Frontend.** render. **Rollback.** flag.
**Tests.** semantics-only guard; resolver unit tests without a DB.
**Decisions.** D9. **Principles.** P2, P3, AC-4.

### FR-REC-2 — Recommend, never decide
**Rationale.** `D7`/`P7`.
**Functional.** Every recommendation presents: recommended action · reason · supporting context · blocker (if any) · role owner (if waiting) · **alternative-action menu**. Deviation must be immediate and unpunished.
**AC.** (1) `[Do this]` + `[Something else ▾]` always present. (2) Deviation ≤ 1 tap. (3) **No forced clinical sequencing.** (4) No automatic clinical decision. (5) No generalized clinical-decision-support engine.
**Decisions.** D7. **Principles.** P7.

---

## 13. Completion Readiness

### FR-CR-1 — Backend owns completion readiness
**Rationale.** `D9`. Verified violation: completion is derived across ~10 frontend modules (ED-ARCH-006/B) and `deriveSummary` acts on its own derivation (ED-ARCH-004).
**Functional.** The backend answers *"can this visit be completed?"* with outstanding mandatory work, optional suggested work, and warnings (incl. billing).
**AC.** (1) **Exactly one** answer (DP-15). (2) Open therapy sessions **coexist** with consultation completion — shown as coexistence, not contradiction. (3) Unbilled services → warning, not block. (4) The frontend renders; it does not compute.
**Depends.** ED-DEP-2 — **the completion route must not be composed until `deriveSummary` is backend-owned.**
**Principles.** P1, P2, P3.

---

## 14. Patient Safety (R7 scope only)

### FR-PS-1 — R7 surfaces only verified-existing signals
**Rationale.** **F-2 = Option A.**
**Functional.** R7 surfaces: pending clinical reviews ✅ · active prescription existence/status ✅ · active episode ✅ · treatment session progress ✅ · billing state ✅.
**AC.** (1) **No allergy/intolerance/interaction/renal/hepatic/contraindication surface in R7.** (2) The frontend must not fabricate, derive or interpret them. (3) An unbacked safety field is **never** displayed.
**[R8]** the full safety model, backend-first.
**Depends.** ED-DEP-4. **Decisions.** F-2. **Principles.** P1.

---

## 15. Mobile Experience

### FR-MOB-1 — Mobile-first Command Center
**Functional.** Patient summary → today's needs → **sticky next action** → **horizontal scrollable pill rail** → one primary task → minimal scrolling → ≥44pt targets → interruption recovery.
**AC.** (1) Active pill auto-scrolled into view. (2) **No unexplained dot-only representation.** (3) Full or understandable short labels. (4) One primary task at a time. (5) Status never conveyed by colour alone (icon + text).
**Principles.** P9.

### FR-MOB-2 — Workflow pills
**Functional.** 🟢 completed · 🟡 current/action-now · ⚪ pending-available · 🔵 waiting-on-role (**owner named**: "Waiting for Admin/Doctor/Therapist") · 🔴 blocked/error · ⚫ not-applicable (only where showing it is useful).
**AC.** (1) Blue always names the owner. (2) Grey only when genuinely useful. (3) Accessible (icon + text).

## 16. Legacy Transition

### FR-LEG-1 — No screen deleted in R7
**Functional.** Staged: Discover → Introduce → Shadow → Validate → **Redirect** → Deprecate → Remove. R7 reaches at most **Redirect**.
**AC.** (1) No screen removed in R7. (2) Every redirect reversible by flag. (3) Deep links land on the correct stage.

### FR-LEG-2 — Redirects
**Functional.** `start-consultation` · `consultation` · `complete-consultation` → workspace stages via adapters. Standalone casesheet/prescription create/edit → workspace, reusing existing flags ✅ (`caseSheetRouteFlagSwitch`, `prescriptionRouteFlagSwitch`). A standalone "new case sheet per visit" entry **redirects to the Episode's sheet** (it models the wrong thing — FR-CS-1).
**AC.** Redirect tests per route; params preserved.
**Depends.** FR-CR-1 (completion route gated on ED-DEP-2).

---

## 17. Feature Flags

### FR-FLAG-1 — R7 is flag-gated and reversible
**Rationale.** Verified precedent: backend `freshness_v1_enabled` / `clinical_spine_v1_enabled` in `config.py` ✅; frontend `isFreshnessV1Enabled` / `isClinicalSpineV1Enabled` in `useFeatures.ts` ✅.
**Functional.** One umbrella flag `cos_v1`, mirroring the existing mechanism exactly; reuse existing route flags rather than adding new ones.
**AC.** (1) Flag-off = today's behaviour, **no data effect**. (2) Rollback = flag off. (3) ⚠ **Data-shaped changes (supersession versions, contributions) are not rolled back by a flag** — FR-LD-1 requires its own rollback plan.
**Principles.** AC-6.

## 18. Engineering Debt Dependencies (blocking gates)

| ID | Debt | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **ED-DEP-1** | **ED-ARCH-001** — presentation→axiosClient/datasource in reused modules | **No R7 group may compose a module until that module is remediated.** Do not widen into repo-wide refactor. |
| **ED-DEP-2** | **ED-ARCH-004** — `deriveSummary` derives clinical summary/completion and acts on it | **The completion route must not be composed until FR-CR-1 makes it backend-owned.** |
| **ED-DEP-3** | **ED-ARCH-006/A** — `buildSectionConfig` assembles workflow in FE (+ specialty-gated) | **FR-WFA-1 must land before/with any FE workflow rendering.** |
| **ED-DEP-4** | **ED-ARCH-003** — unbacked frontend `allergies` field | FR-PS-1/FR-VCC-4 must not surface it; R8 owns the model. |
| **ED-DEP-5** | **ED-ARCH-002** — `PrescriptionStatus` drift | FR-RX-1 must not be guided by it. Non-blocking. |
| **ED-DEP-6** | **ED-ARCH-006/B** — `SectionProgress` visit-level completion in FE | Non-blocking; per-section save status may remain presentational. |

## 19. Engineering Truth Exceptions

> Recorded per instruction: **do not redesign** — record evidence, affected requirement, recommendation, and continue.

### ETX-1 — R7 permission codes are unverified
**Evidence.** `casesheet.amend`, `prescription.sign`, `billing.view`, `session.execute` etc. are **proposed names**; not yet verified against `org_permissions`.
**Affected.** FR-LD-2, FR-WFA-2, FR-BILL-1, FR-RBAC-1.
**Recommendation.** Group 0 / T-0.2 verifies every code before Group H. **Does not make any requirement impossible.**

### ETX-2 — `tenant_casesheets.episode_id` is nullable; historical data unclassified
**Evidence.** `episode_id: Mapped[UUID | None]`, `ondelete="SET NULL"` ✅. Ratification defers non-nullability behind a data audit.
**Affected.** FR-CS-1.
**Recommendation.** R7 handles null-`episode_id` sheets gracefully; **no nullability migration in R7**; audit precedes any future change.

### ETX-3 — Appointment "purpose" / "patient-stated concern" not verified to exist
**Evidence.** No verified field for either; the wireframe assumes them.
**Affected.** FR-VCC-2 (and FR-WFA-1, which uses purpose as an assembly input).
**Recommendation.** Verify in Group 0. If absent, either model additively (scope decision) **or** render "not recorded" and assemble without purpose. **FR-VCC-2 must not fabricate a purpose** (F-2 discipline). Requirement remains possible either way.

### ETX-4 — Capability change mid-episode is undefined
**Evidence.** No verified behaviour for entitlement revoked while a plan is active.
**Affected.** FR-WFA-1.
**Recommendation.** Implementation-time decision; default proposal — **preserve clinical records, hide future stages** (never delete history; R5 entitlement-loss precedent).

### ETX-5 — Naming collision: `tenant_visits.treatment_plan` is a free-text `TEXT` column
**Evidence.** `treatment_plan: Mapped[str | None]` → `TEXT`, nullable ✅ — the pre-entity representation FR-TP-1 replaces.
**Affected.** FR-TP-1.
**Recommendation.** Requirements/implementation must decide disposition (retain as legacy visit note · migrate · deprecate) and **must ensure implementers never confuse the column with the entity**. Does not block FR-TP-1.

## 20. R7 / R8 Boundary

**In R7:** COS core · VCC (R7-scope signals only) · backend workflow assembly + recommendation + completion readiness · Case Sheet per Episode + current-visit attribution + atomicity + idempotency · living-document supersession · verified prescription lifecycle · Treatment Recommendation → **Plan (entity)** → stable Sessions → schedule attributes → doctor content → therapist actuals · scheduling intents incl. PRN/review-dependent · billing visibility · mobile · legacy redirects · flags.

**Deferred to R8 (integration points only):** structured laboratory measurements · manual lab entry · attachments · LIONIC/LIS/FHIR/device adapters · comparative tables · trend visualisation · measurement-based "what changed" · **Clinical Advice framework** · **prescription copy-forward** · **medication reconciliation** · **allergy/intolerance/interaction/renal/hepatic modelling** · dispensing fulfilment lifecycle · advanced summaries · recommendation confidence.

**Guard.** No requirement above implements an R8 concept. R8 references appear only as `[R8]` integration markers.

---

## 21. RBAC

### FR-RBAC-1 — Role-aware composition, not forked screens
**Functional.** `episodeWorkspaceConfigByRole` ✅ extends 2 → 5 roles (Doctor, Assistant Doctor, Admin, Front desk, Therapist) **as config**. RBAC-flexible: any role holding the permission may act — never one hard-coded profession.
**AC.** (1) One screen, role-composed. (2) Read-only roles see clinically useful content where policy permits. (3) **Backend enforces**; UI hiding is presentation polish only ✅ (`CLAUDE.md` §3). (4) Actionability from backend `blocking_factors`/`waiting_role` (FR-WFA-2).
**Depends.** ETX-1. **Principles.** P1, P9.
