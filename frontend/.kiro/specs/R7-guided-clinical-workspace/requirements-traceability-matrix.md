# R7 — Requirements Traceability Matrix

**Companion to** [`requirements.md`](requirements.md) (same directory). **Status:** Draft, not approved. Documentation only.

**Why one file, not two.** Each requirement already carries its principles/decisions/dependencies inline, so a second "requirements-to-task-mapping" document would mostly duplicate it. What is *not* available inline is (a) a compact index, (b) the **reverse** direction — task group → requirements — and (c) **two-way coverage proof**. This file provides exactly those three and nothing else, per "do not create documentation for its own sake."

**Counts:** 42 functional requirements · 8 architecture constraints · 6 engineering-debt gates · 5 Engineering Truth Exceptions.

## 1. Requirement → Principle · Decision · Design doc · Task group

Principles: `P1` Backend Owns Clinical Truth · `P2` Backend Owns Workflow Intelligence · `P3` DP-15 · `P4` One Case Sheet/Episode · `P5` Append-only Contributions · `P6` Supersession · `P7` Recommend+Deviate · `P8` Capability-driven · `P9` Frontend presentation only.

## 3. Coverage proof

- **Every requirement maps to ≥1 group** ✅ (42/42; FR-RX-2 maps to R8 by design — it is a *negative* requirement: "not in R7").
- **Every group maps to ≥1 requirement** ✅ (Group -1 is a gate over all; Group Z covers AC-1..8).
- **Every owner decision is realized** ✅: D1→FR-CS-1/2 · D2→FR-LD-1..3 · D3→FR-RX-1 · D4→[R8] · D5→FR-RX-2 · D6→FR-BILL-1/2 · D7→FR-REC-2 · D8→boundary + FR-VCC-3 · D9→FR-WFA-1/FR-REC-1/FR-CR-1 · F-1→FR-CS-2/3/4 · F-2→FR-VCC-4/FR-PS-1 · Plan→FR-TP-1..3 · Missed→FR-TS-5.
- **Every principle is enforced by ≥1 requirement** ✅: P1(12) P2(5) P3(6) P4(3) P5(5) P6(5) P7(1) P8(5) P9(6).
- **Every ED gate binds ≥1 group** ✅: ED-DEP-1→0/all FE · ED-DEP-2→D-BE/I · ED-DEP-3→D-BE/D-FE · ED-DEP-4→C-* · ED-DEP-5→A-BE/D-FE · ED-DEP-6→D-BE.
- **Every ETX has an owning group** ✅: ETX-1→0/H · ETX-2→A-BE · ETX-3→0/C-FE · ETX-4→D-BE · ETX-5→E-BE.

## 4. Critical path

```
-1 (gate, satisfied) → 0 (ED-ARCH-001 remediation, ETX-1/ETX-3)
   → A-BE (F-1: attribution + atomicity + idempotency)  → A-FE
   → B-BE → B-FE
   → C-BE (F-2 Option A scope) → C-FE
   → D-BE (assembly + recommendation + readiness)  → D-FE  [hard dependency]
   → E-BE (Plan entity ⚠migration + sessions + scheduling) → E-FE
   → F-BE → F-FE → G (schema; deferrable) → H → I → J → K → Z
```
**Hard blocks:** ED-DEP-1 blocks all FE composition · ED-DEP-2 blocks Group I's completion route · ED-DEP-3 blocks FE workflow rendering · D-FE cannot precede D-BE (no interim FE derivation).
