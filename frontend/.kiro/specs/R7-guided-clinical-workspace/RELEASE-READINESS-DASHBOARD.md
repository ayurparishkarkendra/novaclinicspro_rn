# RELEASE-READINESS-DASHBOARD — NovaClinics Clinical Operating System

**As of:** 2026-07-27 (full reconciliation pass) · Backend `186f11f74c9ebd7986689a3919459ad69d446ea6` · Frontend `d69ade484d936cc2f819b40a15758ff22a7ce9d7`

> **[2026-07-26] Partially stale as of `T-FE-E.2`.** This document was generated from `RTM-MASTER.md`'s 2026-07-27 pass and has NOT been rewritten for `T-FE-E.2`'s partial completion (commits `4fba2ec4`/`80fb96d0`). In particular: Prescription and Treatment Recommendation composition are now done (not "not started"); Session Instructions and Scheduling have real partial composition (current state + write); the Treatment Plan gap is now understood specifically — `TenantTreatmentPlan` has zero public HTTP contract — with a proposed remediation, `T-BE-D.4a`. Treat every `T-FE-E.2`-referencing line below as superseded by `RTM-MASTER.md`'s per-requirement `[Updated 2026-07-26]` markers; this document was not line-by-line corrected to match.

> **[2026-07-27] Further update: `T-BE-D.4a` + `T-FE-E.2` closure.** The gap the banner above describes is now closed for Treatment Plan and the scheduling-proposal preview: `T-BE-D.4a` (backend commit `c69f7ef`) exposed the Treatment Plan public contract, and `TreatmentPlanModule` + `SchedulingModule`'s proposal consumption compose it (frontend commit `bfe31956`). `T-FE-E.2` is still not COMPLETE -- the sole remaining gap is author-once-apply-to-many (FR-TS-3's own AC), blocked on the separate, still-unstarted `T-BE-E.3`, out of this closure's own scope. Treat every `T-FE-E.2`/`T-BE-D.4a`-referencing line below as superseded by `RTM-MASTER.md`'s per-requirement `[Updated 2026-07-27]` markers; this document was not line-by-line corrected to match.


**Legend:** ✅ Complete · 🟠 Implemented, Not Exposed (service-only — no router/caller reaches it) · 🟡 Partial · 🔴 Not Started · N/A Not Applicable to this capability

**Reconciliation note.** This dashboard is fully rewritten this pass, not addended. **Workflow Engine** and **Recommendation Engine** move from 🔴/🔴 to ✅/✅ on Frontend/Release — `T-FE-B.1`, `T-FE-B.2`, `T-FE-D.1` had shipped (commits `6e667d15`, `acfa730a`, `426967bb`) without this dashboard being updated, the same staleness `RTM-MASTER.md`'s reconciliation found in five requirement cards. Every other row was independently re-verified via `git log` and source inspection this pass; see `RTM-MASTER.md`'s Reconciliation Evidence section for method.

| Mobile-First Presentation (full polish) | N/A | 🟡 | ✅ | 🟡 | **Deferred** (`T-FE-G.1` judged optional at task level) |

**Overall Release column [Updated 2026-07-27, full reconciliation]: 6 ✅ (Clinical Workspace Shell, Patient Safety, Workflow Engine, Recommendation Engine, Case Sheet Continuity, Clinical History) · 1 🟡 (Mobile, deferred anyway) · 8 🔴 (Prescription, Treatment Recommendation & Plan, Session Scheduling, Doctor Session Instructions, Therapist Execution, Billing, Role-Based Workflow, Legacy Navigation) · 1 🔴 not-applicable-to-BE/FE-split (Living Documents, both sides 🔴) · 1 🔴 (Release Validation, never run).** Of the 16 in-scope-for-MVP capabilities (excluding the 1 deferred), **6 are release-ready today** — up from 3 in the prior (stale) pass, purely from correcting the Workflow/Recommendation Engine staleness, not from new work.

**Reading this dashboard correctly:** every remaining 🔴 in the Release column except Living Documents and Role-Based Workflow is now driven by a ✅ Backend column paired with a 🔴 Frontend column — meaning most of the remaining engineering risk for Prescription/Treatment Recommendation/Plan/Scheduling/Doctor Session Instructions/Therapist Execution/Billing is frontend composition (`T-FE-E.2`, `T-FE-E.3`, `T-FE-E.4`), not backend design, implementation, or exposure risk. Living Documents is the one capability with zero implementation on either side. Release Validation (Group Z) has not run once — no dashboard row above should be read as "release-ready" in the sense of having passed an end-to-end gate, only as "its own task-level AC is met."
