  // `key={episodeId:appointmentId}` forced-remount was replaced by
  // useConsultationWorkspace.ts's own internal reset-on-episode/appointment-
  // change effects (casesheet, prescription, treatment recommendation all
  // already reset their local draft/refs when episodeId/appointmentId
  // changes) plus T-A.2's query invalidation — not from destroying and
  // recreating the whole component. This was only safe after fixing ED-003
  // — a stale-closure race in the reset-vs-sync effect pair the remount had
  // been masking (see useConsultationWorkspace.ts's
  // casesheetDataRef/isTreatmentSentRef comments) — and its treatment-
  // recommendation analog, found and fixed in the same task (T-A.5).
  //
  // T-A.6 (RB-1): the remount is conditionally restored when the freshness
  // flag is OFF, so toggling the flag off reproduces the exact pre-Phase-1
  // behavior ("no data effect" on rollback) — the invalidation calls in
  // useConsultationWorkspace.ts are gated behind the same flag.
  //
  // R3A · T-A.2: renders ClinicalWorkspace (which wraps the unchanged
  // ConsultationWorkspaceScreen in WorkspaceProvider) instead of
  // ConsultationWorkspaceScreen directly. The key expression itself is
  // untouched — it now remounts ClinicalWorkspace (context + screen
  // together) when the flag is OFF, which preserves the exact same
  // observable behavior the pre-existing remount had.
