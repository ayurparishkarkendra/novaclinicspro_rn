/**
 * Canonical query key family for the Clinical Workspace aggregate.

 * `detail` carries all four identity dimensions the endpoint is scoped
 * by — tenant, client (patient), episode, and appointment (Visit) — so
 * two different Visit/patient/Episode contexts can never share a cache
 * entry. This is deliberately wider than consultationCompletionKeys.detail
 * (tenantId/episodeId/appointmentId only, no clientId) — that narrower
 * precedent predates this task's explicit identity-leakage requirement
 * and is not itself expanded here (out of this task's scope).
